      "disease": "Atrial fibrillation",
      "diagnosis": "You may not know you have atrial fibrillation (AFib). The condition may be found when a health checkup is done for another reason.To diagnose AFib, the health care provider examines you and asks questions about your medical history and symptoms. Tests may be done to look for conditions that can cause irregular heartbeats, such as heart disease or thyroid disease.",
      "tests": "Blood tests. Blood tests are done to look for health conditions or substances that may affect the heart or heartbeat.  |  Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and painless test measures the electrical activity of the heart. Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which prints or displays the test results. An ECG can show the heart rhythm and how slow or fast the heart is beating. It's the main test for diagnosing atrial fibrillation.  |  Holter monitor. This small, portable ECG device records the heart's activity. It's worn for a day or two while you do your regular activities.  |  Event recorder. This device is like a Holter monitor, but it records only at certain times for a few minutes at a time. It's typically worn for about 30 days. You usually push a button when you feel symptoms. Some devices automatically record when an irregular heart rhythm is detected.  |  Implantable loop recorder. This device records the heartbeat continuously for up to three years. It's also called a cardiac event recorder. The device shows how the heart is beating while you do your daily activities. It may be used to see how often you have an AFib episode. Sometimes it's used to find rare episodes of AFib in those at high risk of the heart problem. For example, you may need one if you've had an unexplained stroke.  |  Echocardiogram. Sound waves are used to create images of the beating heart. This test can show how blood flows through the heart and heart valves.  |  Exercise stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike while the heart is monitored. The tests show how the heart reacts to exercise. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine that increases the heart rate like exercise does. Sometimes echocardiogram is done during a stress test.  |  Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the condition of the lungs and heart.  |  Our caring tea",

I'm Dr. Mark Tyson, a urologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you might have about bladder cancer.  |  The type of bladder cancer that most patients are diagnosed with is urothelial carcinoma. There are other types of cancers of the bladder, like adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinomas, but urothelial carcinoma is the most common. Some urothelial carcinomas have what's called variant histology, and these can be plasmacytoid, micropapillary, microcystic. These are tumors that generally increase the aggressiveness of the urothelial carcinoma. But in addition to the cell type, you'd also need to know the grade and the stage of your tumor. These tumors are generally graded as low grade and high grade, with high-grade cancers being more aggressive. The grade, the stage, and the type of cancer are all used to determine the type of treatment that you will receive.  |  The treatment options depend on the grade and stage of your tumor. If you have a high-grade, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, we generally treat that with a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, followed by intravesicle therapy, either with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, like BCG. If you have an invasive carcinoma, such as a muscle-invasive cancer, we generally treat that with upfront cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, followed by removal of the bladder or radiation. There are quality of life and toxicity considerations with each of those options, and it's up to the individual to decide which is right for them. Adjuvant immunotherapy is a type of treatment that's given after surgery to help mitigate the risk of cancer recurrence down the road. Patients who have stage 4 bladder cancer are generally treated with first-line cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.  |  The short answer is it really doesn't matter. Whether you had the ",

What tests you'll have and how often depends on your type of bladder cancer and how it was treated, among other factors.In general, doctors recommend a test to examine the inside of your urethra and bladder (cystoscopy) every three to six months for the first few years after bladder cancer treatment. After a few years of surveillance without detecting cancer recurrence, you may need a cystoscopy exam only once a year.

I'm Dr. Katharine Price at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about oral cancer.  |  There are several things that you can do to prevent oral cancer. The most important is not to use any tobacco. It is also important not to drink too much alcohol or to abstain from alcohol altogether. A very simple thing that everyone can do that will decrease the risk of oral cancer is increase fruit and vegetable consumption. It's very important to try and reduce stress and to exercise on a regular basis.  |  So as a cancer doctor, I'm commonly asked what is my chance of cure? And that's a very difficult question because there is no absolute time point where we can say that you are cured of your cancer. But for oral cancer, most of the cancers will come back within the first two years of treatment. And if somebody gets to five years after treatment with no sign of cancer, the chance of it coming back is very, very low. So in general, we think about a five-year mark after cancer treatment as being cured. But again, it is not an absolute cut-off and sometimes we'll see recurrences beyond that point. But it is very unlikely.  |  It is very important for all patients to know that mental illness after or during a diagnosis of oral cancer is very common. The most common things that we'll see are depression and anxiety. Depression is very common, particularly when patients are going through treatment or immediately afterwards where they still have a lot of symptoms that they're trying to recover from. Anxiety would be the most common thing that we see. Because a diagnosis of cancer highlights the uncertainty of the future. None of us know what the future holds.

I'm Dr. Chee-Chee Stucky, a surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you might have about pancreatic cancer.  |  Technically, no. There are some risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer, like smoking and obesity. Those are both modifiable risk factors. So the healthier you are, the less risk you might have of pancreatic cancer. But ultimately if you have a pancreas, there's always a risk of developing pancreatic cancer.  |  The short answer is no. The vast majority of pancreatic cysts will not become cancerous. There are a few, but I would recommend asking your doctor about those.  |  The connection between breast cancer and pancreatic cancer is a genetic mutation called BRCA. So anybody who might have a newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer, but a family history of breast cancer, should definitely undergo genetic testing in order to see if there is a mutation present. If so, the rest of the family needs to undergo screening and possibly genetic testing with the hopes of potentially identifying cancer at an earlier stage.  |  The Whipple procedure is one of the most common procedures we do for pancreatic cancer, Specifically when located in the head or uncinate process of the pancreas. Because of where that tumor is located, we also have to remove everything that's connected to the pancreas, specifically the duodenum and the bile duct, as well as the surrounding lymph nodes. Once it's all removed, then we need to put everything back together, which includes the biliary tract, the pancreatic duct, and the GI tract.  |  You can definitely live without a pancreas.

I'm Dr. Humphreys, a urologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about prostate cancer.  |  If you have low to intermediate risk prostate cancer, there are genomic tests that can better inform on the risk of developing a more aggressive cancer. These tests look at the DNA of your actual cancer cells to compare them to other men, to come up with an individual risk profile for you and your cancer. None of it is 100%, but it does provide the best evidence based on your specific prostate cancer.  |  No, there's no risk to your partner from prostate cancer. There's no risk with sexual activity. Prostate cancer is internal and does not spread through contact.  |  Some prostate cancers are hereditary. If you have prostate cancer, all of your first-degree relatives -- parent, sibling, or child -- are at an elevated risk for developing prostate cancer. If you are diagnosed when you're young in your 40s and develop prostate cancer, you may want to consider a genetic consultation to see if there are any known genetic risk factors that you and your family may have.  |  There's no one thing. A healthy lifestyle with 30 minutes of exercise a day has shown to be protective. Also, diet is important by limiting red meat and eating fresh fruits and vegetables, low in sugars and carbohydrates. I would advise following a heart-healthy diet as research has shown that it is healthy for the prostate as well.  |  No, prostate cancer doesn't spread that way. And there have been millions of biopsies throughout the world and never a single incident of it being spread that way has ever been reported.  |  Not all prostate cancer is lethal and not all prostate cancer requires treatment. As a general rule of thumb, if your life expectancy is 10 years or less, you probably will not have to worry about prostate canc",

These may be signs of prostate cancer in the bones.  |  A computerized tomography scan. A computerized tomography scan, also called a CT scan, is a type of imaging that uses X-ray techniques to create detailed images of the body.

PSMA therapy can treat prostate cancer anywhere in the body. This treatment only works if the prostate cancer cells make the PSMA protein. Side effects include dry mouth, nausea and feeling very tired.  |  Treatments that target the bones. Some radiopharmaceutical medicines contain a radioactive substance that is attracted to bones.

I'm Dr. Mabel Ryder, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about thyroid cancer.  |  The next step after thyroid cancer is diagnosed is to obtain a comprehensive, high-resolution ultrasound. This is important because papillary thyroid cancer and other types of thyroid cancer commonly spread to lymph nodes in the neck. If these are positive for thyroid cancer, fortunately, the surgeon will do a comprehensive surgery to remove both the thyroid and the lymph nodes.  |  Fortunately, the prognosis for most patients with thyroid cancer is excellent. This means that the thyroid cancer is not life-threatening and very treatable. In a small group of patients, the disease may be advanced. With greater science, with data from the laboratory and clinical trials, and with technology, we're able to improve the treatments for our patients. And these patients have improved outcomes and better prognosis.  |  Fortunately, for small thyroid cancers, it does not impact the function of the gland. We measure the function of the gland by measuring hormones called TSH and T4. And if these are normal, it means the thyroid function has been preserved.  |  If you've been diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer, you may be able to save part of your thyroid. We know that most papillary thyroid cancers - under 3 to 4 centimeters - that are confined to the thyroid are low risk. This means that patients can undergo lobectomy to remove half the gland instead of the entire gland. The benefit of this is that you might be able to preserve your own thyroid function after surgery.  |  Many patients are concerned about their quality of life and function after removing the thyroid gland. Fortunately, we have a hormone called levothyroxine or Synthroid. This hormone is bioidentical to the hormone your thyroid produced. It's safe. It's ",

Sometimes stroke symptoms may be temporary, lasting only several minutes or hours, and this is called a transient ischemic attack. The symptoms should not be ignored even if they are temporary. The risk of stroke is markedly increased in the days and weeks after those symptoms occur, so seek emergency evaluation to clarify why the symptoms occurred and how best to prevent a future stroke.  |  An aneurysm is a small saccular-shaped or berry-shaped out-pouching off of an artery in the brain. About two to three percent of the population has a brain aneurysm, and most never cause any symptoms. But on occasion, that aneurysm can rupture, leading to bleeding into and surrounding the brain, a bleeding type of stroke called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. People with that type of hemorrhage typically present with a sudden onset of a very severe headache, unlike anything they've ever experienced before, and they should seek emergency medical care.  |  The brain cells are affected very quickly after a stroke occurs. In the most common type of stroke, called an ischemic stroke, or cerebral infarction, there's a lack of blood flow to an area of the brain leading the brain cells to begin to die off due to a lack of oxygen and other nutrients.

Ilyas, M.B.B.S., Transplant Hepatologist, Mayo Clinic Hi, I'm Dr. Sumera Ilyas, a transplant hepatologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about cirrhosis.  |  Can I still drink alcohol with liver disease?  |  No amount of alcohol is considered safe in patients with cirrhosis. They should avoid all alcohol use.  |  Are pain medications safe to take with liver disease?  |  Well, some pain medications are safe to take in certain doses, and some are not. For instance, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, they should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis, because when the liver is scarred, there's a greater chance of hurting the kidneys with these types of medications. Narcotics such as oxycodone are not a good idea either as they can be quite problematic with certain complications of cirrhosis. Acetaminophen, on the other hand, is safe to take, but at smaller doses. For pain relief in cirrhosis, we recommend taking acetaminophen up to two grams a day. So that's four extra strength tablets within a 24-hour period.  |  How can diet help manage my cirrhosis?  |  So it's important to eat an overall healthy diet that is balanced and full of fruits and vegetables. It's important to have protein intake, and that can be from lean sources of protein such as beans or lentils, and salt restriction is also very important. Limit the amount of salt in your diet to less than two grams of total intake a day.  |  Will taking supplements help my cirrhosis?  |  Although certain herbal supplements such as milk thistle have been tried in liver disease, there's no evidence to suggest that herbal supplements or any other alternative therapies can effectively treat cirrhosis. However, there is a chance of herbal supplements causing harm to ",

One of these checks for blood in the stool and needs to be repeated every year. Another test checks for blood and tumor markers in the stool to look for colon polyps or colorectal cancer and is repeated every three years. If any of the stool-based tests are positive, a colonoscopy is recommended soon afterward.  |  \"Generally speaking, we encourage all adults over the age of 50 – and even older adults who have at least 10 years of very high-quality life expectancy – to participate in screening,\" Dr. Kisiel says.  |  He says you might be surprised how often colonoscopies uncover polyps lurking in your colon.  |  \"Precancerous polyps are extremely common,\" he says. \"We expect to find them in more than a quarter of the colonoscopies that we do at a minimum.

Remember that nothing you do to improve your health is ever too little. And nothing you do to improve your health is ever too late.  |  Cholesterol is always involved in the initiation of the narrowing of the arteries to the heart. And every plaque or narrowing of your arteries contains cholesterol. It is essential to control the cholesterol in order to optimally lower your chance of a heart attack.  |  Yes. All the studies that have shown regression of arterial narrowing have done three things. First, take care of the obvious factors like high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol. Second, address diet and physical activity. And third, help patients manage stress.  |  No. Half of the time, the first symptom a person has of coronary artery disease is actually a heart attack. And half of these heart attacks are fatal. So overall, for one out of four people, the first symptom is what we term sudden cardiac death.  |  No. Studies have shown that even if your cholesterol is well control with medicines, if you do not eat a healthy diet, your heart attack, stroke, and death rate is not significantly reduced.  |  Yes. Since your heart beats one hundred thousand times a day, even mild elevations of blood pressure above 130 over 80 can cause significant health problems, including heart attacks, strokes and heart failure.  |  I tell people they have a new part-time job called Your Health.

The percentage of time that is spent daily with glucose between 70 and 180 milligram per deciliter is the main measurement of appropriate treatment. This percentage should be 70% or higher daily. In addition, percentage of time spent with glucose below 70 should be less than four percent and greater than 250 should be less than five percent. Clearly, hemoglobin A1C testing to evaluate adequacy of treatment is not enough.  |  In certain people with type one diabetes transplantation can be undertaken.

Research includes new chemotherapy medicines that target the changed genes in DMG tumors.Clinical trials are studying medicines that target these cancer cells specifically and deliver them directly to the tumor via a catheter and other novel methods.Clinical trials also are looking at immunotherapy treatments for DMG. Immunotherapy medicines help the body's immune system find and destroy cancer cells. These medicines include immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. All of these treatments target cancer cells through the immune system.Current clinical trials are investigating the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy. In this treatment, white blood cells called T cells are removed from the blood. In a lab, scientists change these T cells and add a receptor called a CAR. The CAR allows the T cells to track and find cancer cells more easily.Scientists then grow and multiply the CAR-T cells in a lab, producing millions of very powerful cells. These CAR-T cells are put back into the blood through a needle placed in a vein in the arm, also called an IV. CAR T-cells can keep living and working in the body for a long time, so they're sometimes called a \"living drug.\"",

In certain very severe situations, if surgery can't be performed, transplant may be indicated.  |  The specific symptoms that a child may have if they have congenital heart disease are really dependent on the age of the child. For infants, their biggest source of caloric expenditure is actually while eating. And thus most signs of congenital heart disease or heart failure actually come when they're eating. This can include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or even sweating while they're feeding. Younger children will often present with symptoms related to their abdominal system. They may have nausea, vomiting with eating, and they may get those symptoms with activity as well. Older teenagers meanwhile, tend to present more symptoms such as chest pain, fainting or palpitations. They also may present with symptoms during exercise or activity. And that's actually a really big red flag for me as a cardiologist. If I hear about a child, especially a teenager who's had chest pain, or has fainted with activity or with exercise, I really need to see that child and I need to make sure that they get an appropriate workup.  |  Often when your child has just been diagnosed with congenital heart disease, it's hard to remember everything that was said to you at that first visit.

      "diagnosis": "Measurements. A regular part of a well-baby medical exam is the measurement of height, weight and head size. At each visit, your pediatrician plots these measurements on a chart to show your child's current percentile ranking for each one. This is important for identifying growth that isn't typical, such as delayed growth or a large head in relation to the rest of the body. If any trends in these charts are a concern, your child's pediatrician may take measurements more often.  |  Appearance. Many distinct facial and skeletal features are related to each of several dwarfism conditions. How your child looks also may help your pediatrician and geneticist make a diagnosis.  |  Imaging technology. Your healthcare professional may order imaging studies, such as X-rays, because certain differences in the skull and skeleton can indicate which condition your child may have. Various imaging devices also may reveal delayed maturation of bones, as is the case when growth hormone levels are low. An MRI scan may show if the pituitary gland or hypothalamus is not typical.  |  Genetic tests. Genetic tests are available for many genetic causes of dwarfism-related conditions. Your doctor may suggest a test to confirm the diagnosis. This test could help manage the condition and aid in family planning. For example, if your doctor thinks your daughter may have Turner syndrome, a special lab test may be done that looks at the X chromosomes in blood cells.  |  Family history. Your pediatrician may ask about the height of your siblings, parents, grandparents or other blood relatives to find out whether the average range of height in your family includes short stature.  |  Hormone tests. Your doctor may order tests that measure levels of growth hormone or other hormones that are critical for childhood growth and development.",

      "treatment": "For people with dwarfism due to low levels of growth hormones, treatment with shots of a synthetic version of the hormone may increase final height. In most cases, children receive daily shots for several years until they reach a maximum adult height — often within the average adult range for their families.Treatment may continue throughout the teen years and early adulthood to achieve development. Some people may need lifelong therapy. Other related hormones may be added to the treatment if their levels also are low.Treatment for girls with Turner syndrome also requires estrogen and related hormone therapy to start puberty and lead to adult sexual development. Estrogen replacement therapy usually continues until the average age of menopause.Giving growth hormones to children with achondroplasia does not increase final average adult height.",
      "medications": "In 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vosoritide, known by the brand name Voxzogo, to improve growth in children who have the most common type of dwarfism.

I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about erectile dysfunction.  |  Problems with erectile dysfunction are super common. If you look at the decade of life, that predicts what percent of men will have problems. So, for example, 50% of 50-year-olds, 60% of 60-year-olds, so on and so forth, will have problems with erections. But that does not necessarily mean that as you get older, you have to have problems of the penis. There are plenty of men in their 60s, 70s and 80s and 90s with great sex lives. In other words, if you take great care your penis, your penis will take great care of you.  |  So the things that you can do to take care of yourself to help with erections include exercising, eating well, including a diet high in fruits and vegetables, having a slimmer waistline, sleeping well, quitting smoking. A lot of these things I mentioned are as powerful as medications in helping with erections and improving your sex life.  |  The penis and overall health is so strongly connected, it's really important to remember that the penis is one of the most powerful predictors we have, especially in young men, for heart attacks. The blood vessels that feed the penis are relatively small. Blood vessels in the heart and the neck are a little bit bigger. So therefore, the penis can predict heart attacks or strokes years in advance when they may occur.  |  Yes and no. So when we talk about what truly is a problem with erectile dysfunction, the definition is a problem that lasts greater than three months and is a consistent inability to obtain or maintain an erection adequate for intercourse. So when young men get problems with erections, which is very, very common because it's normal to have bad nights here and there. And so, if it happens occasionally, you don't need to be as worried about that. But",

I'm here to answer some of the important questions that you might have about endometriosis.  |  I wish I could tell you the answer to that, but unfortunately, we don't know. Currently, we think that the likely source of endometriosis is actually occurring during development as a fetus. So when a baby is developing inside the uterus of its mother, that's when we think endometriosis actually starts.  |  That's a really great question. So endometriosis is something that can be a little bit elusive, but we can suspect it based on symptoms that you might be experiencing. If you're having pain with your periods, pain in your pelvis in general pain with intercourse, urination, bowel movements, all of that may point us to a suspicion of endometriosis. But unfortunately, the only way to say 100% If you do or do not have endometriosis is to do surgery. Because during surgery we can remove tissue, look at it underneath the microscope, and definitively be able to say whether you do or do not have endometriosis.  |  Unfortunately, most of the time, no. The vast majority of endometriosis is superficial endometriosis, meaning that it's almost like paint spackling on a wall, that we can't see it unless we actually go in and take a look surgically. The exception to that is if there's endometriosis actually growing into organs in the pelvis or the abdomen like the bowel or the bladder. That's called deep-infiltrating endometriosis. In those scenarios, we can frequently see that disease either on ultrasound or on MRI.  |  Not necessarily.

An MRI of the brain solely tells you about the structure of the brain but tells you very little about the function of the brain. And that is why migraine doesn't show up on an MRI. Because it's abnormal function in the setting of normal structure.  |  Migraine is highly disabling for some individuals. In fact, it is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. Disabling symptoms are not just the pain, but also the sensitivity to light and sound, as well as the nausea and vomiting.  |  There is a wide range of disease severity in migraine. There are some people who only need a rescue or an acute treatment for migraine because they have infrequent migraine attacks. But there are other people who are having frequent migraine attacks, maybe two or three times a week. If they used rescue treatments for every attack, it could potentially lead to other complications. Those individuals need a preventive treatment regimen to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Those preventive treatments might be daily medications. They might be once a month injections or other injectable medications delivered once every three months.  |  This is why preventive treatment is so crucial. With preventive treatment, we can reduce the frequency as well as the severity of attacks so that you're not having attacks more than two times per week.

Sticky patches (electrodes) are attached to the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Signals are recorded as waves displayed on a monitor or printed on paper. An ECG can show if you are having or have had a heart attack.  |  Blood tests. Certain heart proteins slowly leak into the blood after heart damage from a heart attack. Blood tests can be done to check for these proteins (cardiac markers).  |  Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the condition and size of the heart and lungs.  |  Echocardiogram. Sound waves (ultrasound) create images of the moving heart. This test can show how blood moves through the heart and heart valves. An echocardiogram can help identify whether an area of your heart has been damaged.  |  Coronary catheterization (angiogram). A long, thin tube (catheter) is inserted into an artery, usually in the leg, and guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to help the arteries show up more clearly on images made during the test.  |  Cardiac Computerized Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). These tests create images of the heart and chest. Cardiac CT scans use X-rays. Cardiac MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of your heart. For both tests, you usually lie on a table that slides inside a long tubelike machine. Each test can be used to diagnose heart problems. They can help show the severity of heart damage.",

The earlier a thrombolytic drug is given after a heart attack, the less the heart is damaged and the greater the chance of survival.  |  Other blood-thinning medicines. A medicine called heparin may be given by an intravenous (IV) injection. Heparin makes the blood less sticky and less likely to form clots.  |  Nitroglycerin. This medication widens the blood vessels. It helps improve blood flow to the heart. Nitroglycerin is used to treat sudden chest pain (angina). It's given as a pill under the tongue, as a pill to swallow or as an injection.  |  Morphine. This medicine is given to relieve chest pain that doesn't go away with nitroglycerin.  |  Beta blockers.

Infantile hemangiomas are the most common what we call tumor of infancy and tumor not necessarily implying harmful or malignant but implying growth. We estimate that approximately one in twenty children are born with a hemangioma. We're actually conducting a study right now to determine accurately how many children out of a hundred, say, a hundred children are truly born with this birthmark. Our preliminary results are showing that the number of children born with this type of birthmark has actually been increasing steadily over the last thirty years, so it's becoming more and more common. We don't know quite why children get infantile hemangiomas but we do know that there are several fairly well-defined risk factors -- children that are first born, premature, female and have a low birth weight are at a higher risk for developing infantile hemangiomas than other children.

Sleep is the period during which the body rejuvenates itself. An adequate period of sleep, with good quality of sleep, is very important to manage pain successfully.

A mattress that is too soft will put you back into awkward positions at night and exacerbate painful conditions. A mattress that's too firm will not allow your back and neck to rest and will put pressure on areas of your back and neck. In terms of a pillow, you want one that allows neutral position of your neck. So you don't want your neck overly flexed, you don't want it overly extended.

We do know what exactly happens in the cells. We can see that the cells undergo a genetic change.

But exactly what brought about that genetic change, we don't always know.  |  This is not a disease that's passed down in families, although families can be more susceptible. But we think there are some susceptibility genes that may put you at risk for being more likely to get lymphoma. That does, however, require something else to happen, often in the way of exposures to toxins or viruses or something else.  |  Well, I think it's important to recognize what the goals of treatment are. Low-grade lymphomas have an advantage in that they can take a very long time to cause any symptoms, and certainly a very long time to put the patient's health at risk. However, we do not have a curative treatment that will fix the cancer right away. So we want to weigh up the potential risks and side effects that come with treatment compared to, clearly, the risks and side effects that come from the cancer. So, if you have a cancer that is very low-grade, growing very slowly, giving you no symptoms, we would hold off on treatment and only initiate it when you truly need it.  |  Well, important to know that chemotherapy may have two components. Chemotherapy, or chemical drugs that are targeting the cancer, immunotherapy, or antibody treatments that are going after proteins that are on the outside of the cancer or lymphoma cells. The goal of chemotherapy is to kill quickly- growing cells, which is a good thing because lymphoma, many times, those cells are growing quickly.

Surgery is the only way to fix the calf muscle and free the trapped artery.Surgery is done at a hospital or medical center while you are under general anesthesia. During surgery, the surgeon makes a cut on the inner calf just below or in the back of the knee. This releases the calf muscle to give the artery more room. The calf muscle no longer presses on the artery.Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome surgery takes about an hour. Typically, you'll need to stay in the hospital for one day.If you've had the condition for a long time and have severe narrowing of the artery, you may need another surgery called an artery bypass.Surgery to release the calf muscle and artery usually doesn't affect how the leg works. When the condition is diagnosed and treated early, a full recovery is expected, and symptoms should disappear.",

      "medications": "Medicines are the main schizophrenia treatment. Antipsychotic medicines are the most prescribed drugs. They're thought to control symptoms mainly by affecting brain receptors for different neurotransmitters, or chemical messengers. Most antipsychotic medications act on dopamine and serotonin receptors. A new antipsychotic drug, xanomeline and trospium chloride, affects the acetylcholine receptors.The goal of treatment with antipsychotic medicines is to manage symptoms at the lowest possible dose. To get the desired result, a healthcare professional or mental health professional may try different drugs and combinations of drugs, and different doses, over time. Other medicines also may help, such as antidepressants, mood stabilizers or antianxiety drugs. It can take several weeks to see whether the medicine helps symptoms get better.Because medicines for schizophrenia can cause side effects, people with schizophrenia may not want to take them. A psychiatrist monitors for side effects and in some cases may order blood work. Medication choice can be guided to avoid certain unwanted side effects.Ask your healthcare professional about the benefits and side effects of any medicine that's prescribed. Antipsychotic medicines can be classified as either first-generation or second-generation. Second-generation antipsychotic medicines may have fewer side effects related to muscle movements. This includes tardive dyskinesia, which causes repetitive and involuntary movements, such as grimacing, eye blinking and other movements. Tardive dyskinesia is sometimes permanent.",

Other more significant forms of congenital heart disease may require surgery that could be done via an open heart surgery, or it could be done in the cardiac catheterization lab using different devices or different techniques. In certain very severe situations, if surgery can't be performed, transplant may be indicated.  |  The specific symptoms that a child may have if they have congenital heart disease are really dependent on the age of the child. For infants, their biggest source of caloric expenditure is actually while eating. And thus most signs of congenital heart disease or heart failure actually come when they're eating. This can include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or even sweating while they're feeding. Younger children will often present with symptoms related to their abdominal system. They may have nausea, vomiting with eating, and they may get those symptoms with activity as well. Older teenagers meanwhile, tend to present more symptoms such as chest pain, fainting or palpitations. They also may present with symptoms during exercise or activity. And that's actually a really big red flag for me as a cardiologist. If I hear about a child, especially a teenager who's had chest pain, or has fainted with activity or with exercise, I really need to see that child and I need to make sure that they get an appropriate workup.  |  Often when your child has just been diagnosed with congenital heart disease, it's hard to remember everything that was said to you at that first visit.

Other more significant forms of congenital heart disease may require surgery that could be done via an open heart surgery, or it could be done in the cardiac catheterization lab using different devices or different techniques. In certain very severe situations, if surgery can't be performed, transplant may be indicated.  |  The specific symptoms that a child may have if they have congenital heart disease are really dependent on the age of the child. For infants, their biggest source of caloric expenditure is actually while eating. And thus most signs of congenital heart disease or heart failure actually come when they're eating. This can include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or even sweating while they're feeding. Younger children will often present with symptoms related to their abdominal system. They may have nausea, vomiting with eating, and they may get those symptoms with activity as well. Older teenagers meanwhile, tend to present more symptoms such as chest pain, fainting or palpitations. They also may present with symptoms during exercise or activity. And that's actually a really big red flag for me as a cardiologist. If I hear about a child, especially a teenager who's had chest pain, or has fainted with activity or with exercise, I really need to see that child and I need to make sure that they get an appropriate workup.  |  Often when your child has just been diagnosed with congenital heart disease, it's hard to remember everything that was said to you at that first visit.
