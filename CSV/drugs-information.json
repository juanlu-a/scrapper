    "what_is": "Package insert / product label Dosage form: injection Drug class: Loop diuretics J Code (medical billing code): J1939 (0.5 mg, injection) Bumetanide injection is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required, and dose and dosage schedule have to be adjusted to the individual patient's needs [see Dosage and Administration]. Bumetanide is a loop diuretic, available as 4 mL vials and 10 mL vials (0.25 mg/mL) for intravenous or intramuscular injection as a sterile solution. Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Elimination of bumetanide appears to be considerably slower in neonatal patients compared with adults, possibly because of immature renal and hepatobiliary function in this population. Small pharmacokinetic studies of intravenous bumetanide in preterm and full-term neonates with respiratory disorders have reported an apparent half-life of approximately 6 hours, with a range up to 15 hours and a serum clearance ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 mL/min/kg. In a population of neonates receiving bumetanide for volume overload, mean serum clearance rates were 2.17 mL/min/kg in patients less than 2 months of age and 3.8 mL/min/kg in patients aged 2 to 6 months. Mean serum half-life of bumetanide was 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours in patients aged less than 2 months and those aged 2 to 6 months, respectively. Elimination half-life decreased considerably during the first month of life, from a mean of approximately 6 hours at birth to approximately 2.4 hours at 1 month of age. In a group of ten geriatric subjects between the ages of 65 and 73 years, total bumetanide clearance was significantly lower (1.8 ±",

One or more of these adverse reactions have been reported in approximately 4.1% of patients treated with bumetanide.Less frequent clinical adverse reactions to bumetanide are impaired hearing (0.5%), pruritus (0.4%), electrocardiogram changes (0.4%), weakness (0.2%), hives (0.2%), abdominal pain (0.2%), arthritic pain (0.2%), musculoskeletal pain (0.2%), rash (0.2%) and vomiting (0.2%). One or more of these adverse reactions have been reported in approximately 2.9% of patients treated with bumetanide.Other clinical adverse reactions, which have each occurred in approximately 0.1% of patients, are vertigo, chest pain, ear discomfort, fatigue, dehydration, sweating, hyperventilation, dry mouth, upset stomach, renal failure, asterixis, itching, nipple tenderness, diarrhea, premature ejaculation and difficulty maintaining an erection.Laboratory abnormalities reported have included hyperuricemia (in 18.4% of patients tested), hypochloremia (14.9%), hypokalemia (14.7%), azotemia (10.6%), hyponatremia (9.2%), increased serum creatinine (7.4%), hyperglycemia (6.6%), and variations in phosphorus (4.5%), CO2 content (4.3%), bicarbonate (3.1%) and calcium (2.4%).

Anyone considering the use of doxepin hydrochloride or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior.

Doxycycline hyclate is an antibacterial drug synthetically derived from oxytetracycline, and is available as doxycycline hyclate capsules for oral administration. Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration. Mechanism of Action For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of doxycycline hyclate and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline hyclate capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Doxycycline is indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum in short-term travelers (<4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine resistant strains.

Anyone considering the use of Effexor or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Effexor is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

    "drug": "Fluticasone",
    "what_is": "Package insert / product label Generic name: fluticasone propionate Dosage form: cream Drug class: Topical steroidsFluticasone Propionate Cream, USP 0.05% contains fluticasone propionate [(6α,11β,16α,17α)-6,9,-difluoro-11-hydroxy-16-methyl-3-oxo-17-(1-oxopropoxy)androsta-1,4-diene-17-carbothioic acid, S-fluoromethyl ester], a synthetic fluorinated corticosteroid, for topical dermatologic use. The topical corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents. Like other topical corticosteroids, fluticasone propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2. Fluticasone propionate is lipophilic and has a strong affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor, and virtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors. The therapeutic potency of glucocorticoids is related to the half-life of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex. The half-life of the fluticasone propionate-glucocorticoid receptor complex is approximately 10 hours. Studies performed with Fluticasone Propionate Cream indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids. Fluticasone Propionate Cream, USP 0.05% is a medium potency corticosteroid indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Fluticasone Propionate Cream, USP 0.",
    "side_effects": "In controlled clinical trials of twice-daily administration, the total incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of Fluticasone Propionate Cream was approximately 4%. These adverse reactions were usually mild; self-limiting; and consisted primarily of pruritus, dryness, numbness of fingers, and burning. These events occurred in 2.9%, 1.2%, 1.0%, and 0.6% of patients, respectively. Two clinical studies compared once- to twice-daily administration of Fluticasone Propionate Cream for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema. The local drug-related adverse events for the 491 patients enrolled in both studies are shown in Table 1. In the study enrolling both adult and pediatric patients, the incidence of local adverse events in the 119 pediatric patients ages 1 to 12 years was comparable to the 140 patients ages 13 to 62 years. Fifty-one pediatric patients ages 3 months to 5 years, with moderate to severe eczema, were enrolled in an open-label HPA axis safety study. Fluticasone Propionate Cream was applied twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks over an arithmetic mean body surface area of 64% (range, 35% to 95%). The mean morning cortisol levels with standard deviations before treatment (prestimulation mean value = 13.76 ± 6.94 mcg/dL, poststimulation mean value = 30.53 ± 7.23 mcg/dL) and at end treatment (prestimulation mean value = 12.32 ± 6.92 mcg/dL, poststimulation mean value = 28.84 ± 7.16 mcg/dL) showed little change. In 2 of 43 (4.7%) patients with end-treatment results, peak cortisol levels following cosyntropin stimulation testing were <18 µg/dL, indicating adrenal suppression. Follow-up testing after treatment discontinuation, available for 1 of the 2 subjects, demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis. Local drug-related adverse events were transient burning, resolving the same day it was reported; transient urticaria, resolving the same day it was reported; erythematous rash; dusky erythema, resolving within 1 month after cessation of Fluticasone Prop",

HPV can also cause anal cancer or various cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, oropharynx (the middle part of the throat), or head and neck.HPV 9-valent vaccine is used in children and adults ages 9 through 45 years to prevent genital warts or cancers caused by certain types of HPV.You may receive this vaccine even if you have already had genital warts, or had a positive HPV test or abnormal pap smear in the past. However, this vaccine will not treat active genital warts or HPV-related cancers, and it will not cure HPV infection.HPV 9-valent vaccine prevents diseases caused only by HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. It will not prevent diseases caused by other types of HPV.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HPV vaccine for all boys and girls ages 11 or 12 years old. The vaccine is also recommended in teenage boys and girls who have not already received the vaccine or have not completed all booster shots.Like any vaccine, the HPV 9-valent vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.HPV 9-valent vaccine may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.",

Some people have had seizure like reactions after receiving this vaccine. Your doctor may want you to remain under observation during the first 15 minutes after the injection.Developing cancer from HPV is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.Common side effects of Gardasil 9 may include: pain, swelling, redness, itching, bruising, bleeding, and a lump where the shot was given; nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain; headache; fever; sore throat; dizziness; or tiredness.

When used as a food product, garlic is not likely to produce health benefits or side effects. When used as a medicinal product, garlic may produce both desired and unwanted effects on the body.Garlic products sold as health supplements may vary widely in amount of allicin, the active ingredient in garlic. Allicin is unstable and can be reduced in garlic products that are aged to reduce odor. Odorless garlic may contain little to no allicin. The lower the amount of allicin, the less effective a garlic product might be.Garlic taken orally (by mouth) has been used in alternative medicine as a possibly effective aid in treating high blood pressure, coronary artery disease (hardened arteries), stomach cancer, colon cancer or rectal cancer, and in preventing tick bites. Garlic applied to the skin may also be possibly effective in treating fungal skin infections such as ringworm, jock itch, or athlete's foot.Garlic has also been used to treat high cholesterol, stomach ulcers caused by H. pylori, cancer, or circulation problems in the legs. However, research has shown that garlic may not be effective in treating these conditions.Other uses not proven with research have included preventing the common cold, and improving urination problems caused by an enlarged prostate.It is not certain whether garlic is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. Garlic should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor.Garlic is often sold as an herbal supplement.

The generally accepted therapeutic range for the aPTT during full-dose IV or sub-Q heparin therapy is 1.5–2 times the control value in seconds. The generally accepted therapeutic range for the activated clotting time (ACT) is 2.5–3 times the control value in seconds.Laboratory monitoring of coagulation tests usually not performed with fixed low-dose sub-Q heparin therapy because such tests are generally unaffected or only minimally prolonged. If monitoring is required, it is best performed on samples drawn 4–6 hours after injections. With continuous IV infusion, perform coagulation tests prior to initiation of therapy, approximately every 4 hours during the early stages of therapy, and daily thereafter. With intermittent IV injection, perform coagulation tests prior to each injection during the early stages of therapy, and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Perform periodic platelet counts, hematocrit, and tests for occult blood in stool during the entire course of therapy. When warfarin is indicated for follow-up therapy after initial therapy with heparin, overlap therapy for a minimum of 5 days and until INR is at least 2 for ≥24 hours. When converting to oral dabigatran in patients currently receiving heparin therapy by continuous IV infusion, administer first dose of dabigatran, then immediately discontinue heparin infusion; for those currently receiving intermittently dosed IV heparin therapy, initiate dabigatran within 2 hours prior to what would have been the time of the next scheduled heparin dose.Some manufacturers recommend abrupt discontinuance of heparin therapy after confirmation of adequate response to warfarin. However, some clinicians recommend gradual discontinuance of heparin infusions (e.g., reducing the rate by 50% over 6 hours and then discontinuing over the next 12 hours) because of concern about possible rebound thrombosis.Patie",

For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. Hydroxyzine, when administered to the pregnant mouse, rat, and rabbit, induced fetal abnormalities in the rat and mouse at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range. Clinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are so excreted, hydroxyzine should not be given to nursing mothers. THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, NON-NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND BARBITURATES. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with use of the drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking hydroxyzine pamoate. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs, and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.

In vitro and animal studies show that IMODIUM® (loperamide hydrochloride) acts by slowing intestinal motility and by affecting water and electrolyte movement through the bowel. Loperamide binds to the opiate receptor in the gut wall. Consequently, it inhibits the release of acetylcholine and prostaglandins, thereby reducing peristalsis, and increasing intestinal transit time. Loperamide increases the tone of the anal sphincter, thereby reducing incontinence and urgency.IMODIUM® (loperamide hydrochloride) is indicated for the control and symptomatic relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea and of chronic diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel disease. IMODIUM® is also indicated for reducing the volume of discharge from ileostomies.IMODIUM is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to loperamide hydrochloride or to any of the excipients.Fluid and electrolyte depletion often occur in patients who have diarrhea. In such cases, administration of appropriate fluid and electrolytes is very important. The use of IMODIUM® does not preclude the need for appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy.Extremely rare allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been reported. In acute diarrhea, if clinical improvement is not observed in 48 hours, the administration of IMODIUM® (loperamide hydrochloride) should be discontinued and patients should be advised to consult their physician.

It is an anticholinergic bronchodilator chemically described as 8-Azoniabicyclo [3.2.1]-octane,-3-(3-hydroxy-1-oxo-2-phenylpropoxy)-8-methyl-8-(1-methylethyl)-, bromide, monohydrate ( endo, syn)-,(±)-; a synthetic quaternary ammonium compound, chemically related to atropine. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) agent that, based on animal studies, appears to inhibit vagally-mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) that are caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle.Ipratropium bromide inhalation solution administered either alone or with other bronchodilators, especially beta adrenergics, is indicated as a bronchodilator for maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.Ipratropium bromide is contraindicated in known or suspected cases of hypersensitivity to ipratropium bromide, or to atropine and its derivatives.The use of ipratropium bromide inhalation solution as a single agent for the relief of bronchospasm in acute COPD exacerbation has not been adequately studied. Drugs with faster onset of action may be preferable as initial therapy in this situation.

(8.2) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see Contraindications (4)]. Jasmiel® is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy. Jasmiel is also indicated for the treatment of symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in females of reproductive potential who choose to use an oral contraceptive as their method of contraception. The effectiveness of Jasmiel for PMDD when used for more than three menstrual cycles has not been evaluated.

This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs, including Junel, are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). Junel® 21 and Junel® Fe 28 are progestogen-estrogen combinations.Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).The pharmacokinetics of Junel have not been characterized; however, the following pharmacokinetic information regarding norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol is taken from the literature.Norethindrone acetate appears to be completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone after oral administration, since the disposition of norethindrone acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone (1). Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol (1-3).Volume of distribution of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol ranges from 2 to 4 L/kg (1 to 3). Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (greater than 95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and sex hormone binding globulin, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin (4).Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide ",

This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare(also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare). Ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is contraindicated in persons who have known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or excipients of this formulation.Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%.

The adverse reaction most commonly (≥1% on lacosamide) leading to discontinuation was dizziness. Adverse reactions that occurred in this study were generally similar to those that occurred in adjunctive placebo-controlled studies. One adverse reaction, insomnia, occurred at a rate of ≥2% and was not reported at a similar rate in previous studies.

Adverse experiences may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported. The adverse experiences under Central Nervous System and Cardiovascular System are listed, in general, in a progression from mild to severe. Central Nervous System: CNS reactions are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory reactions may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case, the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness, merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Cardiovascular System: Cardiovascular reactions are usually depressant in nature and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to lidocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means.

For Intranasal Use Only Triamcinolone acetonide, USP, the active ingredient in Nasacort® Nasal Inhaler, is a glucocorticosteroid with a molecular weight of 434.5 and with the chemical designation 9-Fluoro-11β,16α,17,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with acetone. (C24H31FO6). Triamcinolone acetonide is a more potent derivative of triamcinolone. Although triamcinolone itself is approximately one to two times as potent as prednisone in animal models of inflammation, triamcinolone acetonide is approximately 8 times more potent than prednisone.In double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trials of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, in adults and adolescents in fixed total daily doses of 110, 220 and 440 mcg per day, the responses to aerosolized triamcinolone acetonide demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over placebo. In open label trials where the doses were sometimes adjusted according to patients' signs and symptoms, the daily doses and regimens varied. The most commonly used dose was 110 mcg per day.Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief when using Nasacort. It is recommended that dosing be started at 220 mcg once a day and the effect be assessed in four to seven days.Some relief can be expected in approximately two-thirds of patients within four to seven days. If greater effect is desired an increase of dose to 440 mcg once a day can be tried. If adequate relief has not been obtained by the third week of Nasacort treatment, alternate forms of treatment should be considered.In children 6 through 11 years of age, it is recommended that dosing be started at 220 mcg given ",
    "side_effects": "Adults and Children 12 years of age and older In controlled and uncontrolled studies, 1257 adult and adolescent patients received treatment with intranasal triamcinolone acetonide. Adverse reactions are based on the 567 patients who received a product similar to the marketed Nasacort canister. These patients were treated for an average of 48 days (range 1 to 117 days). The 145 patients enrolled in uncontrolled studies received treatment from 1 to 820 days (average 332 days). The most prevalent adverse experience was headache, being reported by approximately 18% of the patients who received Nasacort. Nasal irritation was reported by 2.8% of the patients receiving Nasacort. Other nasopharyngeal side effects were reported by fewer than 5% of the patients who received Nasacort and included: dry mucous membranes, naso-sinus congestion, throat discomfort, sneezing, and epistaxis. The complaints do not usually interfere with treatment and in the controlled and uncontrolled studies approximately 1% of patients have discontinued because of these nasal adverse effects. In the event of accidental overdose, an increased potential for these adverse experiences may be expected, but systemic adverse experiences are unlikely (see OVERDOSAGE section). Children 6 through 11 years of age Adverse event data in children 6 through 11 years of age are derived from two controlled clinical trials of two and four weeks duration. In these trials, 127 patients received fixed doses of 220 mcg/day of triamcinolone acetonide for an average of 22 days (range 8 to 33 days).

Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker or calcium channel blocker).Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect.Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max= 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in elderly hypertensive patients (≥65 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults.

    "side_effects": "In multiple-dose US and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride capsules alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Angina The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (n=520) and placebo (n=310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category).

(3). 200 mcg/mL, or 1000 mcg/mL of octreotide (as acetate) in a multi-dose amber vials individually boxed. (3) Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) in patients with acromegaly are gallbladder abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. In other patients, most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are gallbladder abnormalities. (6.1). See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION.Octreotide acetate injection is indicated to reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses.Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for treatment of severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors.Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for the treatment of the profuse watery diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPomas)-secreting tumors.Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects.The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously.

Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding.

If therapy is reinstituted, it should be at a lower dosage. Should these symptoms occur in children or pregnant patients, the drug should be stopped and not reinstituted. In most cases barbiturates by suitable route of administration will suffice, or injectable diphenhydramine may be useful.

Suitable supportive measures such as maintaining a clear airway and adequate hydration should be employed. Motor Restlessness Symptoms may include agitation or jitteriness and sometimes insomnia. These symptoms often disappear spontaneously. At times these symptoms may be similar to the original neurotic or psychotic symptoms.

Westcort® (hydrocortisone valerate ointment) Ointment, 0.2% contains hydrocortisone valerate, 11,21-dihydroxy-17-[(1-oxopentyl)oxy]-(11β)-pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, a synthetic corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use. The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents. Like other topical corticosteroids, hydrocortisone valerate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps The safety data described below are based on two placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating doses of a fluticasone propionate nasal spray with an exhalation delivery system from 93 mcg twice daily to 372 mcg twice daily. Both trials were 16-weeks in duration with an additional 8-week open-label extension. The trials included a total of 643 adult patients with bilateral nasal polyps and associated moderate or severe nasal congestion of which 161 received 93 mcg twice daily, 160 received 186 mcg twice daily, 161 received 372 mcg twice daily and 161 received placebo. The overall pooled safety data included 296 (46.0%) Female, 347 (54.0%) Male, 584 (90.8%) White, 39 (6.1%) Black, 9 (1.4%) Asian, and 11 (1.7%) patients classified as Other.

Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. The onset of action is 3 to 5 minutes. It is ineffective when applied to intact skin. Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon concentration and total dose administered, the specific site of application, and duration of exposure. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug may appear in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) 2% Jelly is indicated for prevention and control of pain in procedures involving the male and female urethra, for topical treatment of painful urethritis, and as an anesthetic lubricant for endotracheal intubation (oral and nasal).
