# Disease Tag Column Addition - Summary

## Changes Made to `main_diseases_analyzer_final.py`

### Updated Excel Structure

The "All Unique Medications" sheet now includes a **Disease Tag** column that shows which disease(s) each medication is associated with.

**New Column Structure:**
- **Column A**: MEDICATION NAME
- **Column B**: WHAT IS 
- **Column C**: SIDE EFFECTS
- **Column D**: CALL A DOCTOR IF
- **Column E**: GO TO ER IF
- **Column F**: DISEASE TAG âœ… (NEW)

### Key Changes

1. **Enhanced Data Collection**: Modified the medication extraction logic to track disease associations for each medication

2. **Disease Mapping**: Added `medication_to_diseases` dictionary to store which diseases each medication belongs to

3. **Multiple Disease Support**: If a medication appears in multiple diseases, all diseases are listed (separated by semicolons)

4. **Immediate Population**: The Disease Tag column is populated immediately during Excel generation (no need for separate scraping)

5. **Updated Layout**: Adjusted column widths and merged cell ranges to accommodate the new column

### Data Examples

Sample medications with their disease tags:
- **5-HTP Mood and Stress**: Depression (major depressive disorder)
- **A-G Profen**: Arthritis  
- **Achromycin V**: Arthritis
- **Actimmune**: Chronic kidney disease
- **Activase**: Stroke

### Benefits

1. **Complete Tracking**: Now we know exactly which disease(s) each medication treats
2. **Data Relationships**: Easy to see medication-disease associations
3. **Multi-Disease Support**: Medications used for multiple conditions show all diseases
4. **No Additional Scraping**: Disease information comes from existing disease sheets

### Verification

âœ… Script runs successfully  
âœ… 327 medications processed with disease tags  
âœ… All 6 columns properly structured  
âœ… Disease associations correctly populated  
âœ… Compatible with existing LLM scraper structure  

### Output File

The updated Excel file is saved at:
`/Users/juanlu/Documents/Wye/scrapper/Analysis/main_diseases_analysis_final.xlsx`

Now when you run the LLM scraper, it will populate columns B-E (What Is, Side Effects, Call Doctor, Go to ER) while column F (Disease Tag) is already filled with the disease associations! ðŸŽ‰
