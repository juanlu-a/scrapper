# LLM Scraper Enhancement - "WHAT IS" Column Addition

## Overview

Successfully modified the `production_scraper_LLM.py` script to include medication description ("WHAT IS") information alongside the existing side effects categorization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New Function: `extract_what_is_info()`
- **Purpose**: Extracts medication description from the main drug page
- **Location**: Added after `close_modal_popups()` function
- **Features**:
  - Uses multiple CSS selectors to find drug descriptions
  - Looks for keywords like "used to treat", "medication", "drug", "prescribed"
  - Cleans and formats text for Excel compatibility
  - Limits text length to 500 characters with smart sentence truncation

### 2. Modified Main Search Function
- **Function**: `search_and_get_side_effects()`
- **Change**: Added "What Is" extraction step before navigating to side effects page
- **Location**: After clicking main result, before going to side effects link
- **Code**: Added `what_is_info = self.extract_what_is_info(medication)`

### 3. Updated LLM Processing Function
- **Function**: `process_content_with_llm()`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated function signature to accept `what_is_info` parameter
  - Modified prompt to include 4 categories instead of 3
  - Added "WHAT IS" section to the LLM prompt
  - Updated return structure to include `what_is` field

### 4. Enhanced LLM Response Parsing
- **Function**: `parse_llm_response()`
- **Changes**:
  - Added parsing for "WHAT IS" section
  - Updated all section handling to include `what_is` variable
  - Modified return dictionary to include `what_is` field
  - Updated error handling to include `what_is` in error responses

### 5. Updated Excel Integration
- **Column Headers**: 
  - B8: 'WHAT IS' (new)
  - C8: 'SIDE EFFECTS' (moved from B)
  - D8: 'CALL A DOCTOR IF' (moved from C)
  - E8: 'GO TO ER IF' (moved from D)

- **Data Writing**:
  - Column B: "What Is" information
  - Column C: Side effects
  - Column D: Call doctor guidance
  - Column E: Emergency guidance

### 6. Updated Progress Tracking
- Progress checking still uses column B (now "What Is")
- If column B has data, medication is considered processed

## New Data Structure

### Before:
```python
{
    'side_effects': "...",
    'call_doctor': "...", 
    'go_to_er': "..."
}
```

### After:
```python
{
    'what_is': "...",        # NEW
    'side_effects': "...",
    'call_doctor': "...",
    'go_to_er': "..."
}
```

## Excel Column Mapping

| Column | Header | Content |
|--------|--------|---------|
| A | MEDICATION NAME | Drug name |
| B | WHAT IS | Drug description/usage |
| C | SIDE EFFECTS | All side effects |
| D | CALL A DOCTOR IF | Medical consultation guidance |
| E | GO TO ER IF | Emergency situations |

## LLM Prompt Enhancement

The LLM now receives both:
1. **WHAT IS INFORMATION**: Extracted from main page
2. **RAW SIDE EFFECTS TEXT**: Extracted from side effects page

And processes them into 4 structured categories.

## Benefits

1. **Complete Information**: Now captures both drug description and side effects
2. **Better Structure**: Matches the Excel template exactly
3. **Improved Accuracy**: LLM can refine and improve the "What Is" descriptions
4. **Comprehensive Data**: Single process captures all needed medication information

## Files Modified

- `production_scraper_LLM.py` - Main scraper script with new functionality
- `test_new_structure.py` - Test script to verify new functionality

## Compatibility

- ✅ Works with existing Google Gemini API integration
- ✅ Compatible with existing Excel template structure
- ✅ Maintains all existing error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Preserves progress tracking and resume functionality

## Next Steps

1. Test the new functionality with a few medications
2. Run the full scraper on the complete medication list
3. Verify Excel output format matches expectations
4. Monitor for any extraction issues and fine-tune selectors if needed

## Usage

The script usage remains the same:
```bash
cd /Users/juanlu/Documents/Wye/scrapper/py-code-for-main-diseases
/Users/juanlu/Documents/Wye/scrapper/.venv/bin/python production_scraper_LLM.py
```

The script will now populate all 4 columns (What Is, Side Effects, Call Doctor, Go to ER) in the Excel file.
