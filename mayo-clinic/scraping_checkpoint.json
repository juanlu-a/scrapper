EEG results show changes in brain activity. This may help diagnose brain conditions such as epilepsy and other seizure conditions. Your child's healthcare professional asks for a detailed description of the seizures and does a physical exam. Tests may include: Electroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small metal plates called electrodes that are attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap. Rapid breathing, known as hyperventilation, during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the typical pattern. Brain scans. Brain-imaging methods such as MRI can help rule out other conditions, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Brain scans produce detailed images of the brain. Because your child needs to hold still for long periods, talk with your healthcare professional about the possible use of sedation.

Side effects of valproic acid include nausea, attention problems, increased appetite and weight gain. Rarely, the medicine can cause inflammation of the pancreas and liver failure. Females who continue to need medicine into adulthood need to talk about the potential risks of valproic acid with their healthcare professionals. Valproic acid has been linked to a higher risk of birth defects in babies. Healthcare professionals typically advise not using it during pregnancy or while trying to conceive.; Lamotrigine (Lamictal). Some studies show this medicine to be less effective than ethosuximide or valproic acid, but it has fewer side effects. Side effects may include rash and nausea.",

      "diagnosis": "Achalasia can be overlooked or misdiagnosed because it has symptoms similar to those of other digestive disorders. To test for achalasia, a healthcare professional is likely to recommend: Esophageal manometry. This test measures the muscle contractions in the esophagus during swallowing. It also measures how well the lower esophageal sphincter opens during a swallow. This test is the most helpful when deciding which type of swallowing condition you might have. X-rays of the upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after drinking a chalky liquid called barium. The barium coats the inside lining of the digestive tract and fills digestive organs. This coating allows a healthcare professional to see a silhouette of the esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. In addition to drinking the liquid, swallowing a barium pill can help show a blockage in the esophagus. Upper endoscopy. An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube to visually examine the upper digestive system. Endoscopy can be used to find a partial blockage of the esophagus. Endoscopy also can be used to collect a sample of tissue, called a biopsy, to be tested for complications of reflux such as Barrett esophagus. Functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP) technology. FLIP is a new technique that can help confirm an achalasia diagnosis if other tests aren't enough.

      "disease": "Acne",
      "diagnosis": "TreatmentIf you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you: Control your acne Avoid scarring or other damage to your skin Make scars less noticeable Acne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely. The treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves. Topical medicationsThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are: Retinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide. Topical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with brown or Black skin. Adapalene may be tolerated best. Antibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended. Azelaic acid and salicylic acid. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties. A 20% azelaic acid cream or gel seems to be as effective as many conventional acne treatments when used twice a day. Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne.

      "diagnosis": "Acoustic neuroma ear exam at Mayo Clinic A thorough physical exam, including an ear exam, is often the first step in acoustic neuroma diagnosis and treatment. An acoustic neuroma often is hard to diagnose in the early stages because symptoms may be easy to miss and develop slowly over time. Common symptoms such as hearing loss also are associated with many other middle and inner ear issues.After asking questions about your symptoms, a member of your healthcare team conducts an ear exam. You may need the following tests: Hearing test, known as audiometry. This test is conducted by a hearing specialist called an audiologist. During the test, sounds of various tones are directed to one ear at a time. You indicate each time you hear the sound. Each tone is repeated at fainter levels to find out when you can barely hear. The audiologist also may use words to test your hearing. Imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast dye is usually used to diagnose an acoustic neuroma. This imaging test can detect tumors as small as 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. If MRI is not available or you can't have an MRI scan, a CT scan may be done. However, CT scans may miss small tumors.

Your healthcare professional asks about your health history and does a physical exam. You also may need the following tests: IGF-1 measurement. This blood test measures the level of IGF-1 in your blood. A high IGF-1 level can mean that the level of growth hormone also is high. This can be a clue for acromegaly. Growth hormone suppression test. This blood test measures your growth hormone level before and after you drink a type of sugar water called glucose. In people who don't have acromegaly, the glucose drink typically causes the growth hormone level to fall. But if you have acromegaly, your growth hormone level tends to stay high. Imaging tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help pinpoint the location and size of a tumor in your pituitary gland. If no pituitary tumors are seen, you may need more imaging tests to look for other types of tumors. Your healthcare professional also may recommend X-rays of the hands and feet.

The medicines octreotide (Mycapssa, Sandostatin) and lanreotide (Somatuline Depot) are lab-made versions of somatostatin. Taking one of these medicines signals the pituitary gland to make less growth hormone. That also helps lower IGF-1. These medicines also might make a pituitary tumor smaller. You take the medicines by mouth or receive a monthly shot.; Medicines called dopamine agonists that lower hormone levels. The medicines cabergoline and bromocriptine (Cycloset, Parlodel) may help lower levels of GH and IGF-1 in some people. These medicines also may help make a tumor smaller. You take dopamine agonists by mouth, and the doses often are high. That can raise the risk of side effects. Side effects can include upset stomach, vomiting, stuffy nose, tiredness, dizziness, sleep problems and mood changes.; Medicine called a growth hormone antagonist that blocks the action of growth hormone. The medicine pegvisomant (Somavert) blocks the effect of growth hormone on the body's tissues and results in lower IGF-1 levels. Pegvisomant doesn't lower the level of growth hormone or shrink tumor size.

This test looks for blockages in the heart arteries. A doctor places a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist. It's guided to the heart. Dye flows through the tube to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on images taken during the test. Some heart treatments can be done during this test.; Echocardiogram. Sound waves create pictures of the beating heart. This test shows how blood flows through the heart and heart valves. An echocardiogram can show whether the heart is pumping as it should.; Myocardial perfusion imaging. This test shows how well blood flows through the heart muscle. A tiny, safe amount of radioactive substance is given through a vein. A special camera takes pictures of the substance as it moves through the blood vessels of the heart. The test helps find areas of poor blood flow or damage in the heart.; CT angiogram. This test looks at the arteries that supply blood to the heart. It uses a powerful X-ray machine to create images of the heart and its blood vessels. The test can find any buildup of plaque in and on the walls of the coronary artery walls.; Exercise stress test. A stress test shows how well the heart works when you exercise. It often involves walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart is checked. If you can't exercise, you might get medicine that affects the heart like exercise does. This test is done only when you have no symptoms of acute coronary syndrome or another life-threatening heart condition when you are at rest. Other tests may be done during the stress test to see how well the heart works.; Coronary angiogram; Echocardiogram; Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)",

A prothrombin time test measures how long it takes blood to clot. With acute liver failure, blood doesn't clot as quickly as it should. Imaging tests. A healthcare professional may recommend an ultrasound exam to look at the liver. Such testing may show liver damage and help find the cause of the liver problems. A health professional also may recommend abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the liver and blood vessels. These tests can look for certain causes of acute liver failure, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome or tumors. They may be used if a problem is suspected and ultrasound testing does not find the problem. Examination of liver tissue. A healthcare professional may recommend removing a small piece of liver tissue, called a liver biopsy. Doing so may help discover why the liver is failing. Since people with acute liver failure are at risk of bleeding during biopsy, a transjugular liver biopsy may be performed. This procedure involves making a tiny incision on the right side of the neck. A thin tube called a catheter is then inserted into a neck vein, through the heart and into a vein exiting the liver. A needle is then threaded through the catheter to retrieve a sample of liver tissue. More InformationLiver biopsyLiver function testsUltrasound",

Blood tests may reveal too many or too few white blood cells, not enough red blood cells, and not enough platelets. A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in the bone marrow. Bone marrow test. During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells. Doctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan. Imaging tests. Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.

The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.; Preventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.; Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.; Targeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.; Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.; Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person. A bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).; Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body. CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.; Clinical trials.

Many people who have adult Still disease require treatment with steroids, such as prednisone. These powerful drugs reduce inflammation. They may lower the body's resistance to infections and increase the risk of developing osteoporosis and diabetes.; Methotrexate. The medicine methotrexate (Trexall) is often used in combination with prednisone. The prednisone dose is reduced when combined with methotrexate.; Biologic response modifiers. If other medicines haven't worked, your health care provider may recommend a biologic response modifier. Biologic response modifiers are medicines that block proteins causing inflammation. These medicines are often referred to as biologics. Anakinra (Kineret), canakinumab (Ilaris) and tocilizumab (Actemra) are some biologics that are used to treat adult Still disease.

The tests may help your healthcare team better identify the disease causing dementia symptoms.In the past, Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed for certain only after death when plaques and tangles were found while looking at the brain with a microscope. Today, healthcare professionals and researchers are able to diagnose Alzheimer's disease during life with more certainty.They do this by using a combination of tests that may include tests for biomarkers. Biomarkers can detect if plaques and tangles are present in the brain. Biomarker tests include specific types of positron emission tomography, also known as PET, scans of the brain. Amyloid and tau proteins also can be measured in the fluid part of the blood or in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, known as cerebrospinal fluid. Recently, blood biomarker tests have become accurate enough to tell if someone is likely to have amyloid in the brain.Biomarker tests were mainly used in clinical trials until recently.

Tests to rule out other conditions or help diagnose ALS might include: Electromyogram (EMG). A needle is inserted through the skin into various muscles. The test records the electrical activity of the muscles when they contract and when they're at rest. This can determine if there is a problem with the muscles or nerves. Nerve conduction study. This study measures your nerves' ability to send impulses to muscles in different areas of the body. This test can determine if you have nerve damage. EMG and nerve conduction studies are almost always done together. MRI. Using radio waves and a powerful magnetic field, an MRI produces detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. An MRI can reveal spinal cord tumors, herniated disks in the neck or other conditions that might be causing your symptoms. The highest resolution cameras may sometimes see ALS changes themselves. Blood and urine tests. Analyzing samples of your blood and urine in the laboratory might help eliminate other possible causes of your symptoms. Serum neurofilament light levels, which are measured from blood samples, are generally high in people with ALS. The test can help make a diagnosis early in the disease. Spinal tap, known as a lumbar puncture. This involves removing a sample of spinal fluid for laboratory testing. Spinal fluid is removed using a small needle inserted between two bones in the lower back. The spinal fluid appears typical in people with ALS but may uncover another cause of symptoms. Muscle biopsy. If your health care provider believes you may have a muscle disease rather than ALS, you might undergo a muscle biopsy. While you're under local anesthesia, a small piece of muscle is removed and sent to a lab for analysis. Nerve biopsy. If your health care provider believes you may have a nerve disease rather than ALS, you might undergo a nerve biopsy.

Usually, this exam is all that's needed to diagnose an anal fissure.A more recent, acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A long-lasting, also called chronic, anal fissure likely has a deeper tear. It also may have internal or external fleshy growths. A fissure is considered chronic if it lasts more than eight weeks.The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a symptom of another condition, such as Crohn's disease. A medical professional may recommend further testing to find out if there is an underlying condition. Tests may include: Anoscopy. An anoscope is a tubular device inserted into the anus to help see the rectum and anus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy. In this test, a thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera attached is inserted into the bottom portion of the colon. This test may be done for people younger than 45 who have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. Colonoscopy.

The exam includes looking at the area around and inside your anus.The external opening of an anal fistula is usually easily seen on the skin around the anus. Finding the fistula's internal opening inside the anal canal is more complicated. Knowing the complete path of an anal fistula is important for effective treatment.One or more of the following imaging tests may be used to identify the fistula tunnel: MRI can map the fistula tunnel and provide detailed images of the sphincter muscle and other structures of the pelvic floor. Endoscopic ultrasound, which uses high-frequency sound waves, can identify the fistula, the sphincter muscles and surrounding tissues. Fistulography is an X-ray of the fistula that uses an injected contrast to identify the anal fistula tunnel. Examination under anesthesia. A colon and rectal surgeon may recommend anesthesia during an examination of the fistula. This allows for a thorough look at the fistula tunnel and can identify any possible complications. Other options to identify the fistula's internal opening include: Fistula probe. An instrument specially designed to be inserted through a fistula is used to identify the fistula tunnel. Anoscope. A small endoscope is used to view the anal canal. Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. These procedures use an endoscope to examine the large intestine (colon). Sigmoidoscopy can evaluate the lower part of the colon (sigmoid colon). Colonoscopy, which examines the full length of the colon, is important to look for other disorders, especially if ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease is suspected. An injected dye solution.

      "tests": "Ultrasound; Colonoscopy",
      "treatment": "Fistulotomy. The surgeon cuts the fistula's internal opening, scrapes and flushes out the infected tissue, and then flattens the tunnel and stitches it in place. To treat a more complicated fistula, the surgeon may need to remove some of the tunnel. Fistulotomy may be done in two stages if a significant amount of sphincter muscle must be cut or if the entire tunnel can't be found.; Endorectal advancement flap. The surgeon creates a flap from the rectal wall before removing the fistula's internal opening. The flap is then used to cover the repair. This procedure can reduce the amount of sphincter muscle that is cut.; Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT). LIFT is a two-stage treatment for more-complex or deep fistulas. LIFT allows the surgeon to access the fistula between the sphincter muscles and avoid cutting them. A silk or latex string (seton) is first placed into the fistula tunnel, forcing it to widen over time. Several weeks later, the surgeon removes infected tissue and closes the internal fistula opening.; Seton placement. The surgeon places a seton into the fistula to help drain the infection. This allows the tunnel to heal. This procedure may be combined with surgery.; Fibrin glue and collagen plug. The surgeon clears the tunnel and stitches shut the internal opening. Special glue made from a fibrous protein (fibrin) is then injected through the fistula's external opening. The anal fistula tunnel also can be sealed with a plug of collagen protein and then closed.; Medication. Medication may be part of treatment if Crohn's disease is the cause of an anal fistula.; Ostomy and stoma. The surgeon creates a temporary opening in the abdomen to divert the intestines away from the anal canal. Waste is collected into a bag on the abdomen. This procedure allows the anal area time to heal.; Muscle flap. In very complex anal fistulas, the tunnel may be filled with healthy muscle tissue from the thigh, labia or buttock.",

      "tests": "Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and painless test measures the electrical activity of the heart. Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which displays the test results. An ECG can show if the heart is beating too fast or too slow. The test can show if you are having or have had a heart attack.; Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the condition of the heart and lungs. A chest X-ray may be done to determine if other conditions are causing chest pain symptoms and to see if the heart is enlarged.; Blood tests. Certain heart proteins slowly leak into the blood after heart damage from a heart attack. Blood tests can be done to check for these proteins, called cardiac enzymes.; Stress test. Sometimes angina is easier to diagnose when the heart is working harder. A stress test typically involves walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart is checked. Other tests may be done at the same time as a stress test. If you can't exercise, you might get medicines that affect the heart like exercise does.; Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to create images of the heart in motion. These images can show how blood flows through the heart. An echocardiogram may be done during a stress test.; Nuclear stress test. A nuclear stress test helps measure blood flow to the heart muscle at rest and during stress. It is similar to a routine stress test, but during a nuclear stress test, a radioactive tracer is injected into the bloodstream. A special scanner shows how the tracer moves through the heart arteries. Areas that have small amounts or none of the tracer are likely to have poor blood flow.; Cardiac computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests create images of the heart and chest. Cardiac CT scans use X-rays. Cardiac MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of the heart. For both tests, you usually lie on a table that slides inside a long tubelike machine. Each test can be used to diagnose heart problems. The tests can help show the severity of heart damage.; Coronary angiogram. This test uses X-ray imaging to check the inside of the heart's blood vessels. It's part of a general group of procedures known as cardiac catheterization. A healthcare professional inserts a flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin. It's guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter. The dye makes the heart arteries show up more clearly on an X-ray. The X-ray is called an angiogram.; Chest X-rays; Coronary angiogram",

      "medications": "Nitrates. These medicines are often used to treat angina. Nitrates relax and widen the blood vessels so more blood goes to the heart. The most common form of nitrate used to treat angina is nitroglycerin (Nitrostat). The nitroglycerin pill is placed under the tongue. Your healthcare team might recommend taking a nitrate before activities that typically trigger angina, such as exercise. Some people need to take nitrates on a long-term, preventive basis.; Aspirin. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, making it easier for blood to go through narrowed heart arteries. Preventing blood clots can reduce the risk of a heart attack. Don't start taking a daily aspirin without talking to your care team first.; Clot-preventing drugs. Certain medicines such as clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient) and ticagrelor (Brilinta) make blood platelets less likely to stick together so blood doesn't clot. One of these medicines may be recommended if you can't take aspirin.; Beta blockers. Beta blockers slow the heartbeat. The heart beats with less force, which lowers blood pressure. These medicines also relax blood vessels, which improves blood flow.; Statins. Statins are drugs used to lower blood cholesterol. High cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease and angina. Statins block a substance that the body needs to make cholesterol. They help prevent blockages in the blood vessels.; Calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers, also called calcium antagonists, relax and widen blood vessels to improve blood flow.; Other blood pressure medicines. Other drugs to lower blood pressure include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (ARBs). If you have high blood pressure, diabetes, symptoms of heart failure or chronic kidney disease, your healthcare team may prescribe one of these types of medicines.; Ranolazine. This treatment may be prescribed for chronic stable angina that doesn't get better with other medicines. It may be used alone or with other angina medicines.",

It can help determine the severity of aortic valve disease. There are different types of echocardiograms. The type you have depends on the information your health care team needs. A standard echocardiogram is done from outside the body. The ultrasound device is gently pressed against the skin of the chest above the heart. If more details are needed about the heart, a transesophageal echocardiogram may be done. This type creates pictures of the heart from inside the body. The ultrasound device is attached to a tube that goes down your throat and into the esophagus.; Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick test records the electrical activity of the heart. It shows how the heart beats. Sticky patches are placed on the chest and sometimes the legs. Wires connect the patches to a computer, which displays or prints results.; Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the condition of the heart and lungs. It can help determine if the heart is enlarged, which can be a sign of certain types of aortic valve disease or heart failure.; Cardiac MRI. A cardiac MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the heart. This test may be used to determine the severity of aortic valve disease and measure the size of the aorta.; Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan. A cardiac CT scan uses a series of X-rays to create detailed images of the heart and heart valves. The test may be done to measure the size of the aorta and look at the aortic valve more closely. A CT scan also may be used to measure the amount of calcium in the aortic valve or determine the severity of aortic valve stenosis.; Exercise tests or stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while an ECG or echocardiogram is done. Exercise tests show how the heart reacts to physical activity and whether valve disease symptoms occur during exercise. If you can't exercise, you may get medicine that affects the heart like exercise does.; Cardiac catheterization. This test isn't often used to diagnose aortic valve disease. But it may be done to see how severe aortic valve disease is or to diagnose the condition if other tests can't. In this test, a thin, flexible tube is inserted into a blood vessel, usually in the groin area or arm, and guided to the heart. Cardiac catheterization can give more details about blood flow and how well the heart is working. Certain heart treatments can be done during cardiac catheterization.",

If a standard test doesn't provide enough information, you may have one called a transesophageal echocardiogram. This type creates pictures of the heart from inside the body. It gives a detailed look at the aorta and aortic valve.; Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). An ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart. It shows how fast or how slowly the heart is beating. Sticky patches are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which displays the results.; Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show if the heart or aorta is enlarged. It also can help determine the condition of the lungs.; CT scan of the heart. Also called a cardiac CT, this test uses a series of X-rays to make a detailed image of the heart. You lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. A CT scan also can help confirm a tear in the aorta.; Exercise tests or stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart is checked. Exercise tests show how the heart reacts to physical activity. The tests can show whether valve disease symptoms occur during exercise. If you can't exercise, you might get medicines that affect the heart like exercise does.; Cardiac MRI. This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make detailed pictures of the heart, including the aorta and aortic valve.; Cardiac catheterization. This test isn't always used to find aortic valve regurgitation. But it may be done if other tests aren't able to diagnose the condition or determine how serious it is. Cardiac catheterization may be done before valve replacement surgery to check for blockages. In cardiac catheterization, a doctor inserts a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter in a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist. It's guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X-ray images and video.",

The health professional listens to your heart with a stethoscope. If you have aortic valve stenosis, a sound called a heart murmur may be heard.",
      "tests": "Echocardiogram. Sound waves are used to make pictures of the beating heart. An echocardiogram shows how blood flows through the heart and heart valves. It can tell how severe aortic valve stenosis is. The test also can show if the heart muscle is weakened. There are different types of echocardiograms. The type you have depends on the information your healthcare team needs. A standard echocardiogram is done from outside the body. An ultrasound device moves over the skin of the chest above the heart. If more details are needed about the heart, a transesophageal echocardiogram may be done. This type creates pictures of the heart from inside the body. The ultrasound device attaches to a tube that goes down the throat and into the esophagus.; Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick test records the electrical activity of the heart. It shows how the heart beats. Sticky patches with sensors on them go on the chest and sometimes the legs. Wires connect the patches to a computer, which displays or prints results. Your healthcare professional can look for signal patterns related to heart disease or swelling of the heart's chambers.; Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the condition of the heart and lungs. It can show if the heart is bigger than usual, which can occur in aortic valve stenosis. It also can tell if there is calcium buildup on the aortic valve.; Exercise tests or stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart's activity is checked. Exercise tests show how the heart reacts to physical activity and whether valve disease symptoms happen during exercise. If you can't exercise, you may get medicine that affects the heart like exercise does.; Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan. This test uses several X-rays to create detailed images of the heart and heart valves. The test may be done to check the size of the aorta and look at the aortic valve more closely. A CT scan may be done to see how much calcium buildup is on the valve. It also can show how severe the aortic valve stenosis is.; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A cardiac MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart. This test can show the size of the aorta. It may be used to learn how severe the aortic valve stenosis is.; Cardiac catheterization. This test isn't often used to diagnose aortic valve disease. But it may be done to see how severe aortic valve disease is or to diagnose the condition if other tests can't. In this test, a doctor places a thin, flexible tube into a blood vessel, usually in the groin area or arm, and guides it to the heart. Cardiac catheterization also may be used before aortic valve surgery to make sure the heart arteries are not blocked.; Stage A: At risk.

      "diagnosis": "To help diagnose appendicitis, a healthcare professional will likely take a history of symptoms and examine the abdomen.Tests used to diagnose appendicitis include: Physical exam. A healthcare professional may apply gentle pressure on the painful area. When the pressure is suddenly released, appendicitis pain will often feel worse. This is because of inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity, called the peritoneum. A care professional also may look for abdominal stiffness and a tendency to flex the abdominal muscles in response to pressure over the inflamed appendix. This is called guarding. A care professional also may use a lubricated, gloved finger to examine the lower rectum. This is called a digital rectal exam. People of childbearing age may be given a pelvic exam to check for other problems that could be causing the pain. Blood test. This test checks for a high white blood cell count. A high white blood cell count may mean there's an infection. Urine test. A urine test, also called a urinalysis, may be done. A urinalysis makes sure that a urinary tract infection or a kidney stone isn't causing the pain. Imaging tests. Imaging tests may help confirm appendicitis or find other causes for pain. These tests may include an abdominal X-ray, an abdominal ultrasound, a CT scan or an MRI. More InformationCT scanUltrasoundUrinalysis",

You usually are asked questions about your symptoms and your family health history. You may be sent to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.Your healthcare professional may hear a whooshing sound when listening to your heart with a stethoscope.",
      "tests": "Blood tests. Blood tests can check blood sugar and cholesterol levels. High levels of blood sugar and cholesterol raise the risk of atherosclerosis. A C-reactive protein (CRP) test also may be done to check for a protein linked to inflammation of the arteries.; Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and painless test measures the electrical activity of the heart. During an ECG, sticky patches with sensors on them attach to the chest and sometimes to the arms or legs. Wires connect the sensors to a machine, which displays or prints the results. An ECG can show if there's reduced blood flow to the heart.; Exercise stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart's activity is watched. Because exercise makes the heart pump harder and faster than it does during most daily activities, an exercise stress test can show heart conditions that might otherwise be missed. If you can't exercise, you may get medicine that affects the heart like exercise does.; Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to show blood flow through the heart. It also shows the size and shape of the structures of the heart. Sometimes an echocardiogram is done during an exercise stress test.; Doppler ultrasound. A healthcare professional may use a special ultrasound device to check blood flow at different points in your body. The test results show the speed of blood flow in the arteries. This can reveal any narrowed areas.; Ankle-brachial index (ABI). This test compares the blood pressure in the ankle with that in the arm. It's done to check for atherosclerosis in the arteries in the legs and feet. A difference between the ankle and arm measurements may be due to peripheral artery disease.; Cardiac catheterization and angiogram. This test can show if the coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked. A doctor places a long, thin flexible tube in a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist, and guides it to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on images taken during the test.; Coronary calcium scan, also called a heart scan. This test uses computerized tomography (CT) imaging to look for calcium deposits in the artery walls. A coronary calcium scan may show coronary artery disease before you have symptoms. Results of the test are given as a score. The higher the calcium score, the higher the risk of heart attacks.; Other imaging tests. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or positron emission tomography (PET) also may be used to study the arteries. These tests can show hardening and narrowing of large arteries, as well as aneurysms.; Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis care at Mayo Clinic",

      "medications": "Statins and other cholesterol medicines. These medicines can help lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also called the \"bad\" cholesterol. The medicines also can reduce plaque buildup. Some cholesterol medicines even can reverse the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. Statins are a common type of cholesterol medicine. Other types include niacin, fibrates and bile acid sequestrants. You may need more than one type of cholesterol medicine.; Aspirin. Aspirin helps thin the blood and prevent blood clots. Daily low-dose aspirin therapy may be recommended for the primary prevention of heart attack or stroke in certain people. Primary prevention means you've never had a heart attack or stroke. You've never had coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty with stent placement. You've never had blocked arteries in your neck, legs or other parts of the body. But you take a daily aspirin to prevent such heart events. The benefit of aspirin for this use has been debated. Don't start taking a daily aspirin without talking to a healthcare professional.; Blood pressure medicine. Medicines to lower blood pressure don't help reverse atherosclerosis. Instead they prevent or treat complications related to the disease. For example, some blood pressure medicines can help reduce the risk of a heart attack.; Other medicines. Medicines may be used to control other conditions that raise the risk of atherosclerosis. Diabetes is one example. Medicines also may be given to treat specific symptoms of atherosclerosis, such as leg pain during exercise.; Fibrinolytic therapy. If a clot in an artery is blocking blood flow, your healthcare professional may use a clot-dissolving medicine to break it apart. This therapy is generally used in emergency situations.",

A bruit is a whooshing sound caused by blood quickly flowing through arteries and veins of an AVM. It sounds like water rushing through a narrow pipe. A bruit can interfere with your hearing or sleep or cause emotional distress.Tests commonly used to help diagnose AVM include: Cerebral angiography. This test looks for an AVM in the brain. Also called arteriography, this test uses a special dye called a contrast agent injected into an artery. The dye highlights the blood vessels to better show them on X-rays. CT scan. These scans can help show bleeding. CT scans use X-rays to create images of the head, brain or spinal cord. CT angiography. This test combines a CT scan with an injection of a dye to help find an AVM that is bleeding. MRI. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to show detailed images of tissues. An MRI can pick up on small changes in these tissues. Magnetic resonance angiography, also known as an MRA. MRA captures the pattern and the speed and distance of blood flow through the irregular vessels. Transcranial doppler ultrasound. This test can help diagnose an AVM and tell whether the AVM is bleeding. The test uses high-frequency sound waves aimed at arteries to create an image of blood flow and its speed.

NSAIDs are also available as creams or gels, which can be rubbed on joints.; Counterirritants. Some varieties of creams and ointments contain menthol or capsaicin, the ingredient that makes hot peppers spicy. Rubbing these preparations on the skin over your aching joint may interfere with the transmission of pain signals from the joint itself.; Steroids. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Corticosteroids may be given as a pill or as an injection into the painful joint. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes.; Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage.

      "treatment": "Prevention and long-term control are key to stopping asthma attacks before they start; Treatment usually involves learning to recognize your triggers, taking steps to avoid triggers and tracking your breathing to make sure your medications are keeping symptoms under control; In case of an asthma flare-up, you may need to use a quick-relief inhaler.",
      "medications": "Inhaled corticosteroids. These medications include fluticasone propionate (Flovent HFA, Flovent Diskus, Xhance), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Pulmicort Respules, Rhinocort), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar Redihaler), mometasone (Asmanex HFA, Asmanex Twisthaler) and fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta). You may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Unlike oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids have a relatively low risk of serious side effects.; Leukotriene modifiers. These oral medications — including montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo) — help relieve asthma symptoms. Montelukast has been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if you experience any of these reactions.; Combination inhalers. These medications — such as fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA, Airduo Digihaler, others), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), formoterol-mometasone (Dulera) and fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (Breo Ellipta) — contain a long-acting beta agonist along with a corticosteroid.; Theophylline. Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin, Theochron) is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open by relaxing the muscles around the airways. It's not used as often as other asthma medications and requires regular blood tests.; Short-acting beta agonists. These inhaled, quick-relief bronchodilators act within minutes to rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and levalbuterol (Xopenex, Xopenex HFA). Short-acting beta agonists can be taken using a portable, hand-held inhaler or a nebulizer, a machine that converts asthma medications to a fine mist. They're inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.; Anticholinergic agents. Like other bronchodilators, ipratropium (Atrovent HFA) and tiotropium (Spiriva, Spiriva Respimat) act quickly to immediately relax your airways, making it easier to breathe. They're mostly used for emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but can be used to treat asthma.; Oral and intravenous corticosteroids. These medications — which include prednisone (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) and methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol) — relieve airway inflammation caused by severe asthma. They can cause serious side effects when used long term, so these drugs are used only on a short-term basis to treat severe asthma symptoms.; Allergy shots (immunotherapy). Over time, allergy shots gradually reduce your immune system reaction to specific allergens. You generally receive shots once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years.; Biologics. These medications — which include omalizumab (Xolair), mepolizumab (Nucala), dupilumab (Dupixent), reslizumab (Cinqair), benralizumab (Fasenra) and tezepelumab (Tezspire) — are specifically for people who have severe asthma.",

      "diagnosis": "If your symptoms don't improve with at-home treatment, you will need to see your healthcare professional or get emergency care. Even if symptoms improve with at-home treatment, your healthcare professional may want to see you soon for an exam, depending on the severity of symptoms.If you go to your clinic or the emergency room for treatment, you will likely get treatments and have tests at the same time. The goal is to improve your breathing, to judge how severe an asthma attack is and to see whether the treatment is working.Tests to measure how well your lungs are working may include: Peak flow meter. This device measures how quickly you can force air out of your lungs. Peak flow readings are usually a percentage of how your lungs work at their best. Spirometer. A spirometer measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can breathe out. This measurement is called forced expiratory volume (FEV-1). Your FEV-1 measurement is compared with the typical FEV-1 for people who don't have asthma. As with your peak flow reading, this comparison is often given as a percentage. Pulse oximeter. This small device clipped on the end of a finger measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. This shows how well the lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood. Nitric oxide measurement. This exam measures the amount of nitric oxide gas you have in your breath when you exhale. High nitric oxide readings are present when there is swelling or other immune system activity in the lungs. This test would likely not be used in emergency care. More InformationSpirometry",

      "disease": "Astrocytoma",
      "diagnosis": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose astrocytoma include: Neurological exam. During a neurological exam, a member of your healthcare team will ask about your symptoms. Your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes will be checked. Problems in one or more of these areas may help show the part of your brain affected by a brain tumor. Imaging tests. Imaging tests can help figure out the location and size of the brain tumor. MRI is often used to diagnose brain tumors. It may be used along with specialized MRI imaging, such as functional MRI, perfusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Other imaging tests may include CT and positron emission tomography scans, also called PET scans. Removing a sample of tissue for testing. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue from the tumor for testing. Often the sample is taken during surgery to remove the astrocytoma. If the astrocytoma is in a spot that's hard to reach with surgical tools, a needle might be used to get the sample. Which method is used depends on your situation. The tissue goes to a laboratory for review. Tests can determine the types of cells and how quickly they grow. Special tests can show detailed information about the tumor cells. Tests might look for changes in the genetic material of the tumor cells, called DNA. The results tell your healthcare team about your prognosis. Your team uses this information to create a treatment plan.",
      "tests": "Biopsy",
      "treatment": "Surgery to remove the astrocytoma. A brain surgeon, also called a neurosurgeon, works to remove as much of the astrocytoma as possible. The goal is to remove all of the tumor. Sometimes the tumor is in a spot that is hard to reach. It may be too risky to remove it all. Even so, removing some of the astrocytoma may lessen your symptoms. For some people, surgery may be the only treatment needed. For others, more treatments may be recommended to kill any remaining tumor cells and lower the risk of the tumor coming back.; Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill tumor cells. The energy can come from X-rays, protons and other sources. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around you. The machine sends beams to exact points in your brain. The treatment only takes a few minutes. Radiation therapy might be used after surgery. It can be used if the cancer wasn't removed completely or if there's a higher risk the cancer will return. Radiation may be used with chemotherapy for cancers that grow quickly. For people who can't have surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be used as the main treatment.; Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses strong medicines to kill tumor cells. Chemotherapy medicines can be taken in pill form or injected into a vein. Sometimes, a circular wafer of chemotherapy medicine can be put in your brain after surgery. There, it slowly dissolves and releases the medicine. Chemotherapy is often used after surgery to kill any tumor cells that might remain. It can be used with radiation therapy for tumors that grow quickly.; Clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies of new treatments. These studies offer a chance to try the latest treatment options. The risk of side effects may not be known. Ask a member of your healthcare team whether you can participate in a clinical trial.; Supportive care. Supportive care, also called palliative care, focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other healthcare team members to provide extra support. Palliative care can be used at the same time as other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Often, palliative care begins as you start your astrocytoma treatments. You may not need to wait for complications to happen in order to receive palliative care.",

Your healthcare professional checks your vision, balance, coordination and reflexes. You also might need: Blood tests. These might help find treatable causes of ataxia. Imaging studies. An MRI of the brain might help find the possible causes. An MRI can sometimes show shrinkage of the cerebellum and other brain structures in people with ataxia. It also may show other treatable findings, such as a blood clot or benign tumor. A spinal tap, also known as lumbar puncture. This test may be helpful if an infection, swelling — also called inflammation — or certain diseases could be causing ataxia. A needle is inserted into the lower back between two bones to remove a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid. The fluid, which surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord, is sent to a laboratory for testing. Genetic testing. Your healthcare professional might recommend genetic testing to see if a gene change may be causing a condition that leads to ataxia.

A small, hand-held device is pressed against your chest and moved as needed to capture the images. It can find the causes of atelectasis, such as pneumothorax, where air leaks into the space between the lungs and chest wall, and pleural effusion, where fluid builds up around the lungs. Bronchoscopy. During this test, a flexible, lighted tube is placed down your throat. It allows your doctor to see what may be causing a blockage.

Products are available in various strengths and as creams, gels and ointments. Talk with your health care provider about the options and your preferences. Whatever you use, apply it as directed (often twice a day), before you moisturize. Overuse of a corticosteroid product applied to the skin may cause side effects, such as thinning skin. Creams or ointments with a calcineurin inhibitor might be a good option for those over age 2. Examples include tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel). Apply it as directed, before you moisturize. Avoid strong sunlight when using these products. The Food and Drug Administration requires that these products have a black box warning about the risk of lymphoma. This warning is based on rare cases of lymphoma among people using topical calcineurin inhibitors. After 10 years of study, no causal relationship between these products and lymphoma and no increased risk of cancer have been found.; Drugs to fight infection. Your health care provider may prescribe antibiotic pills to treat an infection.; Pills that control inflammation. For more-severe eczema, your health care provider may prescribe pills to help control your symptoms. Options might include cyclosporine, methotrexate, prednisone, mycophenolate and azathioprine. These pills are effective but can't be used long term because of potential serious side effects.; Other options for severe eczema. The injectable biologics (monoclonal antibodies) dupilumab (Dupixent) and tralokinumab (Adbry) might be options for people with moderate to severe disease who don't respond well to other treatment. Studies show that it's safe and effective in easing the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab is for people over age 6. Tralokinumab is for adults.",

It may be used to see how often you have an AFib episode. Sometimes it's used to find rare episodes of AFib in those at high risk of the heart problem. For example, you may need one if you've had an unexplained stroke.; Echocardiogram. Sound waves are used to create images of the beating heart. This test can show how blood flows through the heart and heart valves.; Exercise stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike while the heart is monitored. The tests show how the heart reacts to exercise.

      "tests": "Lab tests. Blood and urine tests are done to look for health conditions or substances that may affect the heart or heartbeat. If your healthcare team thinks you have atrial flutter, you may have blood tests to check your liver, thyroid and kidneys.; Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick test checks the electrical activity of the heart. It can show how fast or how slow the heart is beating. Sticky patches called sensors attach to the chest and sometimes to the arms or legs. Wires connect the patches to a computer, which displays or prints results.; Holter monitor. This portable ECG device can be worn for a day or more to record the heart's activity during daily activities.; Event recorder. This portable ECG device is worn for up to 30 days or until an irregular heartbeat or symptoms occur. You typically press a button when symptoms occur.; Implantable loop recorder. If irregular heartbeat symptoms don't happen very often, this device may be placed under the skin in the chest area. The device constantly records the heart's electrical activity. It can find irregular heart rhythms.; Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to take pictures of the beating heart. It shows the structure of the heart and heart valves. It also shows how blood flows through the heart.; Exercise stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike while the heart activity is checked. The tests show how the heart reacts to exercise. If you can't exercise, you may get medicine that increases the heart rate like exercise does. Sometimes an echocardiogram is done during a stress test.; CT scan of the lungs. You may need this test to check for a blood clot in the lungs, which may cause atrial flutter.; Electrophysiological (EP) study. This test shows where incorrect heart signals start in the heart. A doctor moves one or more flexible tubes through a blood vessel, usually in the groin, to different areas in the heart. Sensors on the tips of the tubes record the heart's electrical signals.; Atrial flutter care at Mayo Clinic",

This may help them manage their symptoms of ADHD.; Special diets. Most diets promoted for ADHD involve not eating foods thought to worsen hyperactivity, such as sugar, and foods that are common allergens, such as wheat, milk and eggs. Some diets recommend staying away from artificial food colorings and additives. So far, studies haven't found a consistent link between diet and fewer symptoms of ADHD. Also, limiting foods may keep children from getting a healthy well-balanced diet. Some evidence based on individual reports or personal experience suggests diet changes might make a difference in children with specific food sensitivities. Using caffeine as a stimulant for children with ADHD can have risky effects and is not recommended.; Vitamin or mineral supplements. While certain vitamins and minerals from foods are needed for good health, there's no evidence that supplemental vitamins or minerals can lessen symptoms of ADHD. \"Megadoses\" of vitamins, which are doses far above the Recommended Dietary Allowance can be harmful.; Herbal supplements. There is no evidence to suggest that herbal remedies help with ADHD, and some may be harmful.; Proprietary formulations. These are products made from vitamins, micronutrients and other ingredients that are sold as possible treatment supplements for children with ADHD. These products have had little or no research and are not monitored by the FDA, making them possibly not effective or harmful.; Essential fatty acids.

For children, the team might include teachers, who look at learning and attention issues. For children and adults, the team might include mental health professionals, called psychologists, who look at how the mind works. And speech-language pathologists can look at the use of language.A hearing specialist called an audiologist may do tests to see what is happening when you or your child hear sounds. These tests might include: Tympanometry. This test can tell if the eardrum isn't moving well. The eardrum needs to move for good hearing. For this test, the audiologist places a soft probe in the ear canal. Then they send small bits of air pressure toward the ear. The probe measures how much the eardrum moves in response to the air. Acoustic reflex test. This test shows what happens in the ear when it hears a loud sound. Auditory brainstem response. This test shows how well the inner ear, called the cochlea, and the brain pathways for hearing are working. An audiologist places sensors around the ear and on the head. The sensors connect to a computer. Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test. The computer records how the nerves between the ears and the brain respond to the sounds. Evoked potential test. This test shows how well sound travels along the nerves that connect the ears to the brain. For this test, an audiologist places sensors on the head. The sensors connect to a computer. Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test. This lets an audiologist see how well sound gets to different parts of the brain. It also shows if anything is blocking the nerves that link the ears to the brain.",

      "treatment": "Hearing aids and listening devices. Your health care team may suggest that you use hearing aids with wireless listening devices. Listening devices help direct sound to you. They get sound from the source to your hearing aid. Frequency modulated, or FM, systems send sounds to you so you can hear them better. They work with a hearing aid and direct sounds to it. These systems help make it easier to hear sounds in noisy environments.; Auditory training. Auditory training, also called hearing rehabilitation, helps you adjust to hearing loss. You may train with an audiologist, a speech-language pathologist or both. You may train one-on-one with a therapist or as part of a group. During auditory training, you learn to tell one type of sound from another. You do this by listening to sounds that are louder and softer, given quickly and slowly. Sounds come from different directions. You also learn to tell the difference between speech sounds, which affects the meaning of the words you hear. Auditory training helps the brain tell the difference between the many sounds you hear every day. The goal is to help you feel like you're able to talk with others more.; Computer-based training. Computer-based programs can help train the brain to recognize and understand sounds. These programs are like auditory training, but you do them online or with a computer program.",

If your child shows any symptoms of autism, you'll likely be referred to a specialist who treats children with autism spectrum disorder for an evaluation. This specialist could be a child psychiatrist or psychologist, a pediatric neurologist, or a developmental pediatrician.Because autism spectrum disorder symptoms and how severe they are can vary widely, it may be hard to make a diagnosis. There is no specific medical test to diagnose autism spectrum disorder. Instead, a specialist may: Observe your child and ask how your child has developed or changed over time in terms of interacting socially, communicating and behaving. Give your child tests covering hearing, speech, language, level of development, and social and behavioral issues. Present structured social and communication interactions to your child and score the performance. Include other specialists in coming up with a diagnosis.

Some programs focus on reducing challenging behaviors and teaching new skills. Other programs focus on teaching children how to act in social situations or communicate better with others. Applied behavior analysis can help children learn new skills and adapt these skills to many situations by motivating them with rewards.; Educational therapies. Children with autism spectrum disorder often respond well to highly structured educational programs. Successful programs usually include a team of specialists and various activities to improve social skills, communication and behavior. Preschool children who get intensive, individualized behavioral treatments often show good progress.; Family therapies. Parents and other family members can learn how to play and interact with children who have autism in ways that support social interaction skills, manage challenging behaviors, and teach daily living skills and communication.; Other therapies. Depending on your child's needs, speech therapy to make communication skills better, occupational therapy to teach activities of daily living, and physical therapy to make movement and balance better may help. A psychologist can recommend ways to manage problem behavior.; Medicines. Medicine can't make the core signs of autism spectrum disorder better, but specific medicines can help control symptoms. For example, certain medicines may be prescribed if your child is hyperactive. Sometimes healthcare professionals prescribe antipsychotic medicines to treat severe behavioral symptoms. Or they may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety. Keep all healthcare professionals updated on any medicines or supplements your child takes.

A liver biopsy is commonly performed by inserting a thin needle through the skin and into the liver. Tests and procedures used to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis include: Blood tests. Testing a sample of blood for antibodies can distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from viral hepatitis and other conditions with similar symptoms. Antibody tests also help pinpoint the type of autoimmune hepatitis you have. Liver biopsy. A sample of liver tissue may be taken to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the degree and type of liver damage. During the biopsy procedure, a thin needle is passed into the liver through a small cut in the skin. The needle is used to take a small sample of liver tissue. The sample is then sent to a laboratory for testing. More InformationLiver biopsy",
      "tests": "Biopsy",
      "treatment": "The goal of treatment for autoimmune hepatitis is to slow or stop the immune system attack on the liver; This may help increase the time before the disease gets worse; To meet this goal, you'll likely need medicines that lower immune system activity; The first treatment is usually prednisone; A second medicine, azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), may be recommended in addition to prednisone.; Prednisone, especially when taken long term, can cause a wide range of serious side effects, including diabetes, weakened or broken bones, high blood pressure, cataracts, glaucoma, and weight gain.; Healthcare professionals typically prescribe prednisone at a high dose for about the first month of treatment; Then, to reduce the risk of side effects, they gradually reduce the dose over the next several months until reaching the lowest possible dose that controls the disease; Adding azathioprine also helps you avoid prednisone side effects.; Although you may experience remission a few years after starting treatment, the disease often returns if the drug is discontinued",

      "disease": "Autoimmune pancreatitis",
      "diagnosis": "Autoimmune pancreatitis is hard to diagnose, because its symptoms are a lot like those of pancreatic cancer. However, an accurate diagnosis is extremely important. Undiagnosed cancer may result in delaying or not receiving necessary treatment.People with AIP tend to have a general enlargement of the pancreas, but they also may have a mass in the pancreas. To pinpoint the diagnosis and determine the type of AIP, blood and imaging tests are necessary.",
      "tests": "Imaging tests. Tests of your pancreas and other organs may include CT, MRI, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).; Blood tests. You may have a test to check for elevated levels of an immunoglobulin called IgG4. IgG4 is produced by your immune system. People with type 1 AIP often have high levels of IgG4 in their blood. People with type 2 AIP usually do not. However, a positive test doesn't necessarily mean that you have the disease. A small number of people who don't have autoimmune pancreatitis, including some with pancreatic cancer, also have high levels of IgG4 in their blood.; Endoscopic core biopsy. In this test, a medical professional called a pathologist studies a sample of pancreatic tissue in the laboratory. AIP has a distinctive appearance that can be easily recognized under a microscope by an expert pathologist. A small tube called an endoscope is inserted through the mouth into the stomach, guided by ultrasound. A sample of tissue is then removed from the pancreas using a special needle. The challenge is getting a sample of tissue large enough to study, rather than just a few cells. This procedure is not widely available, and results may not be conclusive.; Steroid trial. Autoimmune pancreatitis generally responds to steroids; healthcare professionals sometimes use a trial course of this drug to confirm a diagnosis. However, this strategy should ideally happen under expert guidance. It should be used sparingly and only be done when there is strong evidence to support a diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis. Response to corticosteroids is measured by CT and improvement in serum IgG4 levels.",
      "treatment": "Biliary stenting. Before starting medicine, sometimes doctors or other healthcare professionals will insert a tube to drain the biliary ducts. This is called biliary stenting and is done in people with symptoms of obstructive jaundice. Often, though, jaundice improves with steroid treatment alone. Sometimes drainage is recommended if the diagnosis is not certain. Tissue samples and cells from the bile duct may be taken at the time of stent placement.; Steroids. Symptoms of autoimmune pancreatitis often improve after a short course of prednisolone or prednisone. Many people respond quickly, even dramatically. Sometimes people get better without any treatment.; Immunosuppressants and immunomodulators. The disease can relapse. For type 1 AIP, the disease relapses about 30% to 50% of the time. For type 2 AIP, it relapses less than 10% of the time. Cases of relapse require additional treatment, sometimes long term. To help reduce the serious side effects associated with extended steroid use, medicines that suppress or modify the immune system may be added to the treatment. These are sometimes called steroid-sparing medicines. You may be able to stop taking steroids altogether depending on your response to steroid-sparing medicine. Immunosuppressants and immunomodulators include mycophenolate (CellCept), mercaptopurine (Purinethol, Purixan), azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan) and rituximab (Rituxan). In general, they have been used in small sample groups and long-term benefits are still being studied.; Monitoring of other organ involvement. Type 1 AIP often is associated with other organ involvement, including enlarged lymph nodes and salivary glands, scarring of the bile ducts, liver inflammation, and kidney disease. Although these signs may lessen or disappear completely with steroid therapy, your care team will continue to monitor you.",

The results can show if you have kidney problems. After that, you might need other tests that can help confirm an enlarged prostate. These tests include: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. PSA is a protein made in the prostate. PSA levels go up when the prostate becomes enlarged. But higher PSA levels also can be due to recent procedures, illnesses, surgery or prostate cancer. Urinary flow test. You pee into a container attached to a machine. The machine measures how strong your urine flow is and how much urine you pass. Test results can show over time whether your condition is getting better or worse. Postvoid residual volume test. This test measures whether you can empty your bladder fully. The test can be done using an imaging exam called ultrasound. Or it can be done with a tube called a catheter placed into your bladder after you pee to measure how much urine is left in the bladder. 24-hour voiding diary. This involves noting how often and how much you pee. It might be extra helpful if you make more than a third of your daily urine at night. If your health problem is more complex, you may need tests including: Transrectal ultrasound. A device that uses sound waves to make pictures is inserted into the rectum. It measures the size of the prostate. Prostate biopsy. This test uses ultrasound imaging to guide needles that take tissue samples of the prostate. Checking the prostate tissue can help your doctor find out if you have prostate cancer. Urodynamic and pressure flow studies. A catheter is threaded through the urethra into the bladder. Water — or, less often, air — is slowly sent into the bladder to measure bladder pressure and check how well the bladder muscles work when you try to pass urine. Cystoscopy.

You need to take your medicine for the rest of your life — even when you feel better. If you don't keep taking your medicine, your symptoms could come back, or minor mood changes could turn into full-blown mania or depression.; Intensive outpatient programs or a program involving a partial stay in a hospital. These programs provide intensive support and counseling that lasts a few hours per day for several weeks to help you get symptoms under control.; Treatment for alcohol or drug misuse. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need treatment for this misuse. Without this treatment, it can be very hard to manage bipolar disorder.; A hospital stay. Your healthcare professional may recommend that you stay in a hospital if you're behaving dangerously or thinking about suicide, or you've become detached from reality. Getting mental health treatment at a hospital can keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood. This is true whether you're having a manic or major depressive episode.",
      "medications": "Mood stabilizers. Mood-stabilizing medicines help control manic or hypomanic episodes. They also may help depressive bouts. Examples include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid, divalproex sodium (Depakote, Depakote ER), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal).; Antipsychotics. Antipsychotic medicines have mood-stabilizing properties, and many have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for manic or hypomanic episodes or maintenance treatment. Antipsychotics may be used by themselves or with mood stabilizers. Examples of antipsychotic drugs are olanzapine (Zyprexa, Lybalvi, others), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel, Seroquel XR), aripiprazole (Abilify, Aristada, others), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda), asenapine (Saphris), lumateperone (Caplyta) and cariprazine (Vraylar).; Antidepressants. Your healthcare professional may cautiously add an antidepressant to manage depression. But an antidepressant sometimes can cause a manic or hypomanic episode. Antidepressants should be prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic medicine.; Antidepressant-antipsychotic combination. The medicine Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It's approved to treat bipolar depression.; Antianxiety medicines. Benzodiazepines may ease anxiety and make you sleep better. But they're usually used on a short-term basis as they can be misused when taken for a long time.",

      "diagnosis": "Bladder cancer FAQs Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about bladder cancer from urologist Mark Tyson, M.D., M.P.H. Show transcript for video Bladder cancer FAQs Hi. I'm Dr. Mark Tyson, a urologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you might have about bladder cancer. What type of bladder cancer do I have? The type of bladder cancer that most patients are diagnosed with is urothelial carcinoma. There are other types of cancers of the bladder, like adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinomas, but urothelial carcinoma is the most common. Some urothelial carcinomas have what's called variant histology, and these can be plasmacytoid, micropapillary, microcystic. These are tumors that generally increase the aggressiveness of the urothelial carcinoma. But in addition to the cell type, you'd also need to know the grade and the stage of your tumor. These tumors are generally graded as low grade and high grade, with high-grade cancers being more aggressive. The grade, the stage, and the type of cancer are all used to determine the type of treatment that you will receive. What are my treatment options? The treatment options depend on the grade and stage of your tumor. If you have a high-grade, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, we generally treat that with a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, followed by intravesicle therapy, either with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, like BCG. If you have an invasive carcinoma, such as a muscle-invasive cancer, we generally treat that with upfront cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, followed by removal of the bladder or radiation. There are quality of life and toxicity considerations with each of those options, and it's up to the individual to decide which is right for them. Adjuvant immunotherapy is a type of treatment that's given after surgery to help mitigate the risk of cancer recurrence down the road. Patients who have stage 4 bladder cancer are generally treated with first-line cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Should I have my surgery done robotically? The short answer is it really doesn't matter. Whether you had the surgery done open or whether you have it done robotically, the outcomes are about the same. This is a big operation and patients are going to be in the hospital for a few days after surgery and require a few weeks to recover, no matter how the surgery is done. With a robotic approach, though, there are tiny laparoscopic incisions. And in general, there's a little bit less blood loss and perhaps a few fewer wound complications. With the open approach, the surgery is faster, but associated with a little bit more blood loss. And I encourage patients to go with the surgery that feels right for themselves. What is a neobladder? A neobladder is a type of urinary diversion that's performed during the surgery to remove the bladder. So, when we remove the bladder, we have to reroute the urine somewhere. And what we do is we take about",

      "treatment": "Surgery, to remove the cancer cells; Chemotherapy in the bladder (intravesical chemotherapy), to treat cancers that are confined to the lining of the bladder but have a high risk of recurrence or progression to a higher stage; Chemotherapy for the whole body (systemic chemotherapy), to increase the chance for a cure in a person having surgery to remove the bladder, or as a primary treatment when surgery isn't an option; Radiation therapy, to destroy cancer cells, often as a primary treatment when surgery isn't an option or isn't desired; Immunotherapy, to trigger the body's immune system to fight cancer cells, either in the bladder or throughout the body; Targeted therapy, to treat advanced cancer when other treatments haven't helped",

      "disease": "Bladder exstrophy",
      "diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves the steps a healthcare professional takes to find bladder exstrophy. But the condition often is found by chance during a routine pregnancy ultrasound. Other imaging tests such as MRI can help confirm the finding. Signs of bladder exstrophy seen during imaging tests include: A bladder that doesn't fill or empty correctly. An umbilical cord that is placed low on the stomach area. Pubic bones — part of the hipbones that form the pelvis — that are separated. Genitals that are smaller than is typical. Sometimes the condition can't be seen until after the baby is born. In a newborn, healthcare professionals look for: Size of the portion of the bladder that is open and exposed to air. Position of the testicles. Intestine bulging through the abdominal wall, also called an inguinal hernia. Anatomy of the area around the navel. Position of the anus. How much the pubic bones are separated, and how easily the pelvis moves. Mayo Clinic has a state-of-the-art fetal care center that helps in the diagnosis and prenatal management of babies with urology conditions, including BEEC. Mayo Clinic's fetal care center has access to some of the most advanced fetal imaging, including high-resolution ultrasound and fetal MRI.

      "treatment": "Provide enough space for urine storage.; Create outer sex organs that look and work acceptably.; Establish bladder control, also called continence.; Help the kidneys work as well as possible.; Complete repair. This surgery is called complete primary repair of bladder exstrophy. A surgeon closes the bladder and the stomach area and repairs the urethra and outer sex organs. This single surgery can be done soon after birth. Or it can be done when the baby is around 2 to 3 months old. Most surgery for newborns includes repair to the pelvic bones. But surgeons may choose not to do this repair if the baby is less than 72 hours old, the pelvic separation is small and the infant's bones are flexible.; Staged repair. The full name of this approach is modern staged repair of bladder exstrophy. Staged repair involves three surgeries. Often, the first surgery is done within 72 hours after birth. The second is done at age 6 to 12 months. And the last is done at 4 to 5 years. The first surgery closes the bladder and the stomach area. The second surgery repairs the urethra and sex organs. Then, when the child is old enough to start toilet training, surgeons repair a group of muscles involved in bladder control. This muscle group is called the bladder neck.",

To know how serious your brachial plexus injury is, you may need one or more of the following tests: X-ray. An X-ray of the shoulder and neck can show fractures or other related injuries. Electromyography (EMG). During an EMG, a healthcare professional places a needle electrode through the skin into different muscles. The test looks at the electrical activity of the muscles when they tighten and when they're at rest. You may feel a little pain when the electrodes are put in, but most people can finish the test without much discomfort. Nerve conduction studies. These tests are usually done as part of EMG. They measure how fast and how well electrical signals travel down the nerves. This provides information about how well the nerve is working. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to make very detailed images of the organs and tissues in the body. It can show how much damage there is to the brachial plexus after an injury. It also can show any artery damage in the limb, which is important for reconstruction. New types of high-resolution MRI, such as magnetic resonance neurography or diffusion tensor imaging, may be used. Computerized tomography (CT) myelography. Computerized tomography uses a series of X-rays to create images of the body. CT myelography uses contrast dye, injected during a spinal tap, to look for issues in the spinal cord and nerve roots.

You typically press a button when symptoms occur. It's worn for up to 30 days or until symptoms occur.; Tilt table test. This test may be done if you've had fainting spells. A health professional checks your heart rate and blood pressure as you lie flat on a table. The table is tilted to put you in a standing position. The care professional watches how your heart and nervous system respond to the change in position.; Stress exercise test. Some irregular heartbeats are triggered or made worse by exercise. During a stress test, the heart's activity is watched while you ride on a stationary bicycle or walk on a treadmill. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine that affects the heart like exercise does.; Sleep study.

This specialized X-ray is usually the first test used to assess for bleeding in the brain or another type of stroke. The test produces images that are 2D slices of the brain. A CT angiogram can create detailed images of the arteries providing blood flow in the brain. The test involves injecting dye into the vein that makes it easier to observe blood flow. It also can detect the presence of an aneurysm. Lumbar puncture, known as a spinal tap. If you've had a subarachnoid hemorrhage, there will most likely be red blood cells in the fluid surrounding your brain and spine. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. If you have symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm but a CT scan doesn't show evidence of bleeding, a test of your cerebrospinal fluid can help make a diagnosis. The procedure to draw cerebrospinal fluid from your back with a needle is called a lumbar puncture. MRI. This imaging test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. These images may be either 2D or 3D images and can show if there's bleeding in the brain. A type of MRI that captures images of the arteries in detail is called MR angiography. This type of MRI can detect the size, shape and location of an aneurysm. Cerebral angiogram. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is used. The catheter is inserted into an artery, usually in the groin or the wrist. The catheter threads past your heart to the arteries in your brain. A special dye injected into the catheter travels to arteries throughout your brain. A series of X-rays can then reveal details about the conditions of your arteries and detect an aneurysm. A cerebral angiogram — also called a cerebral arteriogram — is usually used when other diagnostic tests don't provide enough information. A doctor shares information about brain aneurysm diagnosis.",

One of these medicines, nimodipine (Nymalize), has been shown to reduce the risk of delayed brain injury caused by insufficient blood flow. This can happen after subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm.; Medicines to open blood vessels. A medicine can be given to dilate the blood vessels. This can be given through an IV in the arm or with a catheter directly into the arteries supplying the brain. This can help prevent a stroke by allowing the blood to flow freely.

Cerebral angiography reveals the location of the feeding arteries and draining veins, which is critical to planning treatment. Cerebral angiography is also known as cerebral arteriography. In this test, a long, thin tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist. The catheter is threaded to the brain using X-ray imaging. A dye is injected into the blood vessels of the brain to make them visible under X-ray imaging. Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed cross-sectional image of the brain. Sometimes a dye is injected through a tube into a vein for the CT scan. This type of test is known as computerized tomography angiography. The dye allows the arteries feeding the AVM and the veins draining the AVM to be viewed in greater detail. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. MRI is more sensitive than CT and can show subtle changes in brain tissue related to a brain AVM. MRI also provides information about the exact location of the brain AVM and any related bleeding in the brain. The information is important for planning treatment.

      "treatment": "Surgical removal, known as resection. Surgery may be recommended if the brain AVM has bled or is in an area that can easily be reached. In this procedure, the surgeon removes part of the skull to gain access to the AVM. With the help of a high-powered microscope, the surgeon seals off the AVM with special clips and carefully removes it from surrounding brain tissue. The surgeon then reattaches the skull bone and closes the incision in the scalp. Resection usually is done when the AVM can be removed with little risk of hemorrhage or seizure. AVMs that are in deep brain regions carry a higher risk of complications, and other treatments may be recommended.; Endovascular embolization. In this procedure, a catheter is inserted into an artery in the leg or wrist. The catheter is threaded through blood vessels to the brain using X-ray imaging. The catheter is positioned in one of the arteries that feeds the brain AVM. The surgeon injects an embolizing agent. This may be small particles, a gluelike substance, microcoils or other materials. The embolizing agent blocks the artery and reduces blood flow into the AVM. Endovascular embolization is less invasive than traditional surgery. It may be performed alone but it's often used before other surgical treatments to make them safer. It does this by reducing the size of the brain AVM or the likelihood of bleeding. In some large brain AVMs, endovascular embolization may be used to reduce stroke-like symptoms by redirecting blood back to brain tissue.; Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). This treatment uses precisely focused radiation to destroy the AVM. This type of surgery doesn't require cuts in the body the way other surgeries do. Instead, SRS directs many highly targeted radiation beams at the AVM to damage the blood vessels and cause scarring. The scarred AVM blood vessels then slowly close in 1 to 3 years. This treatment may be done for small AVMs that are hard to remove with traditional surgery. It also may be done for AVMs that haven't caused dangerous hemorrhages.",

If your health care provider thinks you might have a brain tumor, you'll need a number of tests and procedures to be sure. These might include: A neurological exam. A neurological exam tests different parts of your brain to see how they're working. This exam may include checking your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes. If you have trouble in one or more areas, this is a clue for your health care provider. A neurological exam doesn't detect a brain tumor. But it helps your provider understand what part of your brain might be having a problem. Head CT scan. A computed tomography scan, also called a CT scan, uses X-rays to make pictures. It's widely available, and results come back quickly. So CT might be the first imaging test that's done if you have headaches or other symptoms that have many possible causes. A CT scan can detect problems in and around your brain. The results give your health care provider clues to decide what test to do next. If your provider thinks your CT scan shows a brain tumor, you might need a brain MRI. Brain MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging, also called MRI, uses strong magnets to create pictures of the inside of the body. MRI is often used to detect brain tumors because it shows the brain more clearly than do other imaging tests. Often a dye is injected into a vein in the arm before an MRI. The dye makes clearer pictures. This makes it easier to see smaller tumors. It can help your health care team see the difference between a brain tumor and healthy brain tissue. Sometimes you need a special type of MRI to create more-detailed pictures. One example is functional MRI. This special MRI shows which parts of the brain control speaking, moving and other important tasks. This helps your health care provider plan surgery and other treatments. Another special MRI test is magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This test uses MRI to measure levels of certain chemicals in the tumor cells. Having too much or too little of the chemicals might tell your health care team about the kind of brain tumor you have. Magnetic resonance perfusion is another special type of MRI. This test uses MRI to measure the amount of blood in different parts of the brain tumor. The parts of the tumor that have a higher amount of blood may be the most active parts of the tumor. Your health care team uses this information to plan your treatment. PET scan of the brain. A positron emission tomography scan, also called a PET scan, can detect some brain tumors.

      "disease": "Breast pain",
      "diagnosis": "Tests to evaluate your condition may include: Clinical breast exam. Your doctor checks for changes in your breasts, examining your breasts and the lymph nodes in your lower neck and underarm. Your doctor will likely listen to your heart and lungs and check your chest and abdomen to determine whether the pain could be related to another condition. If your medical history and the breast and physical exam reveal nothing unusual, you may not need additional tests. Mammogram. If your doctor feels a breast lump or unusual thickening, or detects a focused area of pain in your breast tissue, you'll need an X-ray exam of your breast that evaluates the area of concern found during the breast exam (diagnostic mammogram). Ultrasound. An ultrasound exam uses sound waves to produce images of your breasts, and it's often done along with a mammogram. You might need an ultrasound to evaluate a focused area of pain even if the mammogram appears normal. Breast biopsy. Suspicious breast lumps, areas of thickening or unusual areas seen during imaging exams may require a biopsy before your doctor can make a diagnosis. During a biopsy, your doctor obtains a small sample of breast tissue from the area in question and sends it for lab analysis.

      "treatment": "Eliminate an underlying cause or aggravating factor. This may involve a simple adjustment, such as wearing a bra with extra support.; Use a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication. You may need to use NSAIDs when your pain is intense. Your doctor may recommend that you apply an NSAID cream directly to the area where you feel pain.; Adjust birth control pills. If you take birth control pills, skipping the pill-free week or switching birth control methods may help breast pain symptoms. But don't try this without your doctor's advice.; Reduce the dose of menopausal hormone therapy. You might consider lowering the dose of menopausal hormone therapy or stopping it entirely.; Take a prescription medication. Danazol is the only prescription medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating fibrocystic breasts. However, danazol carries the risk of potentially severe side effects, such as heart and liver problems, as well as weight gain and voice changes. Tamoxifen, a prescription medication for breast cancer treatment and prevention, may help, but this drug also carries the potential for side effects that may be more bothersome than the breast pain itself.; Combination birth control pills",
      "medications": "Evening primrose oil. This supplement may change the balance of fatty acids in your cells, which may reduce breast pain.; Vitamin E. Early studies showed a possible beneficial effect of vitamin E on breast pain in premenstrual women who experience breast pain that fluctuates during the menstrual cycle. In one study, 200 international units (IU) of vitamin E taken twice daily for two months improved symptoms in women with cyclic breast pain. There was no additional benefit after four months. For adults older than 18 years, pregnant people and breastfeeding women, the maximum dose of vitamin E is 1,000 milligrams daily (or 1,500 IU).",

You may be asked if you've had any major stresses recently, such as the death of a loved one.People who have broken heart syndrome usually don't have any heart disease symptoms before the condition is diagnosed.Tests to help diagnose broken heart syndrome include: Blood tests. People who have broken heart syndrome often have higher levels of substances called cardiac enzymes in the blood. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick test measures the electrical activity of the heart. Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which shows the test results. An ECG shows how fast or how slow the heart is beating. ECG results for broken heart syndrome look different from those for a heart attack. Coronary angiogram. This test checks for blockages in the heart arteries. It's done to rule out a heart attack. People with broken heart syndrome often don't have any blockages. A doctor inserts a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist. It's guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X-ray images and video. Once it's clear that you're not having a heart attack, your doctor checks to see if your symptoms are caused by broken heart syndrome. Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the beating heart. It shows how blood flows through the heart and heart valves. It can see if the heart is enlarged or has an unusual shape. These changes may be due to broken heart syndrome. Cardiac MRI. This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart.

      "diagnosis": "Spirometer Enlarge image Close Spirometer Spirometer A spirometer is a diagnostic device that measures the amount of air you can breathe in and out and the time it takes you to breathe out completely after you take a deep breath. During the first few days of illness, it can be difficult to distinguish the signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis from those of a common cold. During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen closely to your lungs as you breathe.In some cases, your doctor may suggest the following tests: Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can help determine if you have pneumonia or another condition that may explain your cough. This is especially important if you smoke or have ever smoked. Sputum tests. Sputum is the mucus that you cough up from your lungs. It can be tested to see if you have illnesses that could be helped by antibiotics. Sputum can also be tested for signs of allergies. Pulmonary function test. During a pulmonary function test, you blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can get air out of your lungs. This test checks for signs of asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema. More InformationChest X-rays",

      "treatment": "Most cases of acute bronchitis get better without treatment, usually within a couple of weeks.",
      "medications": "Cough medicine. If your cough keeps you from sleeping, you might try cough suppressants at bedtime.; Other medications. If you have allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), your doctor may recommend an inhaler and other medications to reduce inflammation and open narrowed passages in your lungs.; Antibiotics. Because most cases of acute bronchitis are caused by viral infections, antibiotics aren't effective. However, if your doctor suspects that you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe an antibiotic.",

      "disease": "Buerger disease",
      "diagnosis": "There's no test that can diagnose Buerger disease. But tests can be done to check for other common conditions that may cause similar symptoms.Tests may include: Blood tests. Blood tests may be done to check for diabetes, blood-clotting disorders, or autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma or lupus. Exam of the arteries in hands and feet. Blood pressure cuffs and ultrasound imaging are used to see how blood moves through the hands and feet. This test is often done in a special vascular laboratory. But it can be done at a medical provider's office. Other tests may be done to check blood flow to the skin. CT or MRI scan of the blood vessels. These tests show blood flow in the arteries. Before the images are taken, a special dye may be given by IV. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on the images. Angiogram of the hands and feet. This invasive test helps health care providers see blockages in the very small blood vessels of the hands and feet. A long, thin flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel. Dye, also called contrast, flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X-ray images and video.

      "treatment": "There's no cure for Buerger disease; The only proven treatment for Buerger disease is to quit using all tobacco products; Even one cigarette a day can make the disease worse; This includes using electronic cigarettes, vaping and using marijuana.; If you have Buerger disease and smoke or use tobacco in any form, talk to your health care provider about ways to quit; Nicotine replacement products aren't an option because they still have nicotine in them; Nicotine is thought to irritate the blood vessels; Your health care provider can recommend other medicines that might help.; Another option is a live-in program to help you stop smoking; You typically stay at a treatment center or hospital for a few days or weeks",
      "medications": "If you have Buerger disease, your health care provider may recommend medicine to improve blood flow; For example, some blood pressure medicines may be helpful; Aspirin may be given to prevent blood clots.; A medicine called bosentan (Tracleer) may be tried if you have very severe Buerger disease symptoms; It's approved to treat high blood pressure in the lungs; But a few studies showed that it improved blood flow in people with Buerger disease.; Other medicines depend on your symptoms and other health conditions; Medicines may be given to treat pain or heal skin sores.",
