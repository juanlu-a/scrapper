This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small metal plates called electrodes that are attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap. Rapid breathing, known as hyperventilation, during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the typical pattern. Brain scans. Brain-imaging methods such as MRI can help rule out other conditions, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Brain scans produce detailed images of the brain.

It also measures how well the lower esophageal sphincter opens during a swallow. This test is the most helpful when deciding which type of swallowing condition you might have. X-rays of the upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after drinking a chalky liquid called barium. The barium coats the inside lining of the digestive tract and fills digestive organs. This coating allows a healthcare professional to see a silhouette of the esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. In addition to drinking the liquid, swallowing a barium pill can help show a blockage in the esophagus. Upper endoscopy. An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube to visually examine the upper digestive system. Endoscopy can be used to find a partial blockage of the esophagus. Endoscopy also can be used to collect a sample of tissue, called a biopsy, to be tested for complications of reflux such as Barrett esophagus. Functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP) technology.

An acoustic neuroma often is hard to diagnose in the early stages because symptoms may be easy to miss and develop slowly over time. Common symptoms such as hearing loss also are associated with many other middle and inner ear issues.After asking questions about your symptoms, a member of your healthcare team conducts an ear exam. You may need the following tests: Hearing test, known as audiometry. This test is conducted by a hearing specialist called an audiologist. During the test, sounds of various tones are directed to one ear at a time. You indicate each time you hear the sound. Each tone is repeated at fainter levels to find out when you can barely hear. The audiologist also may use words to test your hearing. Imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast dye is usually used to diagnose an acoustic neuroma. This imaging test can detect tumors as small as 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. If MRI is not available or you can't have an MRI scan, a CT scan may be done. However, CT scans may miss small tumors.

They also can check for proteins in the brain that are linked to Alzheimer's disease. The tests may help your healthcare team better identify the disease causing dementia symptoms.In the past, Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed for certain only after death when plaques and tangles were found while looking at the brain with a microscope. Today, healthcare professionals and researchers are able to diagnose Alzheimer's disease during life with more certainty.They do this by using a combination of tests that may include tests for biomarkers. Biomarkers can detect if plaques and tangles are present in the brain. Biomarker tests include specific types of positron emission tomography, also known as PET, scans of the brain. Amyloid and tau proteins also can be measured in the fluid part of the blood or in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, known as cerebrospinal fluid. Recently, blood biomarker tests have become accurate enough to tell if someone is likely to have amyloid in the brain.Biomarker tests were mainly used in clinical trials until recently. But healthcare professionals have started using them along with other tests to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease.

This study measures your nerves' ability to send impulses to muscles in different areas of the body. This test can determine if you have nerve damage. EMG and nerve conduction studies are almost always done together. MRI. Using radio waves and a powerful magnetic field, an MRI produces detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. An MRI can reveal spinal cord tumors, herniated disks in the neck or other conditions that might be causing your symptoms. The highest resolution cameras may sometimes see ALS changes themselves. Blood and urine tests. Analyzing samples of your blood and urine in the laboratory might help eliminate other possible causes of your symptoms. Serum neurofilament light levels, which are measured from blood samples, are generally high in people with ALS. The test can help make a diagnosis early in the disease. Spinal tap, known as a lumbar puncture. This involves removing a sample of spinal fluid for laboratory testing. Spinal fluid is removed using a small needle inserted between two bones in the lower back. The spinal fluid appears typical in people with ALS but may uncover another cause of symptoms.

Knowing the complete path of an anal fistula is important for effective treatment.One or more of the following imaging tests may be used to identify the fistula tunnel: MRI can map the fistula tunnel and provide detailed images of the sphincter muscle and other structures of the pelvic floor. Endoscopic ultrasound, which uses high-frequency sound waves, can identify the fistula, the sphincter muscles and surrounding tissues. Fistulography is an X-ray of the fistula that uses an injected contrast to identify the anal fistula tunnel. Examination under anesthesia. A colon and rectal surgeon may recommend anesthesia during an examination of the fistula. This allows for a thorough look at the fistula tunnel and can identify any possible complications. Other options to identify the fistula's internal opening include: Fistula probe. An instrument specially designed to be inserted through a fistula is used to identify the fistula tunnel. Anoscope. A small endoscope is used to view the anal canal. Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. These procedures use an endoscope to examine the large intestine (colon). Sigmoidoscopy can evaluate the lower part of the colon (sigmoid colon). Colonoscopy, which examines the full length of the colon, is important to look for other disorders, especially if ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease is suspected. An injected dye solution.

Also called arteriography, this test uses a special dye called a contrast agent injected into an artery. The dye highlights the blood vessels to better show them on X-rays. CT scan. These scans can help show bleeding. CT scans use X-rays to create images of the head, brain or spinal cord. CT angiography. This test combines a CT scan with an injection of a dye to help find an AVM that is bleeding. MRI. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to show detailed images of tissues. An MRI can pick up on small changes in these tissues. Magnetic resonance angiography, also known as an MRA. MRA captures the pattern and the speed and distance of blood flow through the irregular vessels. Transcranial doppler ultrasound. This test can help diagnose an AVM and tell whether the AVM is bleeding. The test uses high-frequency sound waves aimed at arteries to create an image of blood flow and its speed.

    "disease": "Asthma attack",
    "diagnosis": "If your symptoms don't improve with at-home treatment, you will need to see your healthcare professional or get emergency care. Even if symptoms improve with at-home treatment, your healthcare professional may want to see you soon for an exam, depending on the severity of symptoms.If you go to your clinic or the emergency room for treatment, you will likely get treatments and have tests at the same time. The goal is to improve your breathing, to judge how severe an asthma attack is and to see whether the treatment is working.Tests to measure how well your lungs are working may include: Peak flow meter. This device measures how quickly you can force air out of your lungs. Peak flow readings are usually a percentage of how your lungs work at their best. Spirometer. A spirometer measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can breathe out. This measurement is called forced expiratory volume (FEV-1). Your FEV-1 measurement is compared with the typical FEV-1 for people who don't have asthma. As with your peak flow reading, this comparison is often given as a percentage. Pulse oximeter. This small device clipped on the end of a finger measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. This shows how well the lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood. Nitric oxide measurement. This exam measures the amount of nitric oxide gas you have in your breath when you exhale. High nitric oxide readings are present when there is swelling or other immune system activity in the lungs. This test would likely not be used in emergency care. More InformationSpirometry",

Imaging tests. Imaging tests can help figure out the location and size of the brain tumor. MRI is often used to diagnose brain tumors. It may be used along with specialized MRI imaging, such as functional MRI, perfusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Other imaging tests may include CT and positron emission tomography scans, also called PET scans. Removing a sample of tissue for testing. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue from the tumor for testing. Often the sample is taken during surgery to remove the astrocytoma. If the astrocytoma is in a spot that's hard to reach with surgical tools, a needle might be used to get the sample. Which method is used depends on your situation. The tissue goes to a laboratory for review. Tests can determine the types of cells and how quickly they grow. Special tests can show detailed information about the tumor cells. Tests might look for changes in the genetic material of the tumor cells, called DNA. The results tell your healthcare team about your prognosis.

An MRI of the brain might help find the possible causes. An MRI can sometimes show shrinkage of the cerebellum and other brain structures in people with ataxia. It also may show other treatable findings, such as a blood clot or benign tumor. A spinal tap, also known as lumbar puncture. This test may be helpful if an infection, swelling — also called inflammation — or certain diseases could be causing ataxia. A needle is inserted into the lower back between two bones to remove a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid. The fluid, which surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord, is sent to a laboratory for testing. Genetic testing.

The results can show if you have kidney problems. After that, you might need other tests that can help confirm an enlarged prostate. These tests include: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. PSA is a protein made in the prostate. PSA levels go up when the prostate becomes enlarged. But higher PSA levels also can be due to recent procedures, illnesses, surgery or prostate cancer. Urinary flow test. You pee into a container attached to a machine. The machine measures how strong your urine flow is and how much urine you pass. Test results can show over time whether your condition is getting better or worse. Postvoid residual volume test. This test measures whether you can empty your bladder fully. The test can be done using an imaging exam called ultrasound. Or it can be done with a tube called a catheter placed into your bladder after you pee to measure how much urine is left in the bladder. 24-hour voiding diary.

    "diagnosis": "Bladder cancer FAQs Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about bladder cancer from urologist Mark Tyson, M.D., M.P.H. Show transcript for video Bladder cancer FAQs Hi. I'm Dr. Mark Tyson, a urologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you might have about bladder cancer. What type of bladder cancer do I have? The type of bladder cancer that most patients are diagnosed with is urothelial carcinoma. There are other types of cancers of the bladder, like adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinomas, but urothelial carcinoma is the most common. Some urothelial carcinomas have what's called variant histology, and these can be plasmacytoid, micropapillary, microcystic. These are tumors that generally increase the aggressiveness of the urothelial carcinoma. But in addition to the cell type, you'd also need to know the grade and the stage of your tumor. These tumors are generally graded as low grade and high grade, with high-grade cancers being more aggressive. The grade, the stage, and the type of cancer are all used to determine the type of treatment that you will receive. What are my treatment options? The treatment options depend on the grade and stage of your tumor. If you have a high-grade, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, we generally treat that with a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, followed by intravesicle therapy, either with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, like BCG. If you have an invasive carcinoma, such as a muscle-invasive cancer, we generally treat that with upfront cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, followed by removal of the bladder or radiation. There are quality of life and toxicity considerations with each of those options, and it's up to the individual to decide which is right for them. Adjuvant immunotherapy is a type of treatment that's given after surgery to help mitigate the risk of cancer recurrence down the road. Patients who have stage 4 bladder cancer are generally treated with first-line cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Should I have my surgery done robotically? The short answer is it really doesn't matter. Whether you had the surgery done open or whether you have it done robotically, the outcomes are about the same. This is a big operation and patients are going to be in the hospital for a few days after surgery and require a few weeks to recover, no matter how the surgery is done. With a robotic approach, though, there are tiny laparoscopic incisions. And in general, there's a little bit less blood loss and perhaps a few fewer wound complications. With the open approach, the surgery is faster, but associated with a little bit more blood loss. And I encourage patients to go with the surgery that feels right for themselves. What is a neobladder? A neobladder is a type of urinary diversion that's performed during the surgery to remove the bladder. So, when we remove the bladder, we have to reroute the urine somewhere. And what we do is we take about a foot of small intestines, called ileum, and we detubularize it, or fillet it, open. We create it into a sphere. And then we connect that down to the urethra and then we connect the kidneys into that. And it's nice because all of the hardware, so to speak, is on the inside of the body. There's no external drainage bag for urine, like there is with an ileal conduit. But there are some downsides to a neobladder. They don't work perfectly. For example, about 25% of men will have some degree of long-term incontinence, and about 30% of women. About 10% of men will need to catheterize to empty their neobladder and about 25% of women will, as well. And these are important considerations as one is deciding between a neobladder and a conduit. What is an ileal conduit? An ileal conduit is a form of urinary diversion where there's an external bag used for drainage. Unlike a neobladder where we build a new bladder and connect the kidneys to the uret",

    "disease": "Bladder exstrophy",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves the steps a healthcare professional takes to find bladder exstrophy. But the condition often is found by chance during a routine pregnancy ultrasound. Other imaging tests such as MRI can help confirm the finding. Signs of bladder exstrophy seen during imaging tests include: A bladder that doesn't fill or empty correctly. An umbilical cord that is placed low on the stomach area. Pubic bones — part of the hipbones that form the pelvis — that are separated. Genitals that are smaller than is typical. Sometimes the condition can't be seen until after the baby is born. In a newborn, healthcare professionals look for: Size of the portion of the bladder that is open and exposed to air. Position of the testicles. Intestine bulging through the abdominal wall, also called an inguinal hernia. Anatomy of the area around the navel. Position of the anus. How much the pubic bones are separated, and how easily the pelvis moves. Mayo Clinic has a state-of-the-art fetal care center that helps in the diagnosis and prenatal management of babies with urology conditions, including BEEC. Mayo Clinic's fetal care center has access to some of the most advanced fetal imaging, including high-resolution ultrasound and fetal MRI.

To know how serious your brachial plexus injury is, you may need one or more of the following tests: X-ray. An X-ray of the shoulder and neck can show fractures or other related injuries. Electromyography (EMG). During an EMG, a healthcare professional places a needle electrode through the skin into different muscles. The test looks at the electrical activity of the muscles when they tighten and when they're at rest. You may feel a little pain when the electrodes are put in, but most people can finish the test without much discomfort. Nerve conduction studies. These tests are usually done as part of EMG. They measure how fast and how well electrical signals travel down the nerves. This provides information about how well the nerve is working. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to make very detailed images of the organs and tissues in the body. It can show how much damage there is to the brachial plexus after an injury. It also can show any artery damage in the limb, which is important for reconstruction. New types of high-resolution MRI, such as magnetic resonance neurography or diffusion tensor imaging, may be used. Computerized tomography (CT) myelography. Computerized tomography uses a series of X-rays to create images of the body. CT myelography uses contrast dye, injected during a spinal tap, to look for issues in the spinal cord and nerve roots.

It also can detect the presence of an aneurysm. Lumbar puncture, known as a spinal tap. If you've had a subarachnoid hemorrhage, there will most likely be red blood cells in the fluid surrounding your brain and spine. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. If you have symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm but a CT scan doesn't show evidence of bleeding, a test of your cerebrospinal fluid can help make a diagnosis. The procedure to draw cerebrospinal fluid from your back with a needle is called a lumbar puncture. MRI.

A type of MRI that captures images of the arteries in detail is called MR angiography. This type of MRI can detect the size, shape and location of an aneurysm. Cerebral angiogram. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is used. The catheter is inserted into an artery, usually in the groin or the wrist. The catheter threads past your heart to the arteries in your brain. A special dye injected into the catheter travels to arteries throughout your brain. A series of X-rays can then reveal details about the conditions of your arteries and detect an aneurysm.

A CT scan can detect problems in and around your brain. The results give your health care provider clues to decide what test to do next. If your provider thinks your CT scan shows a brain tumor, you might need a brain MRI. Brain MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging, also called MRI, uses strong magnets to create pictures of the inside of the body. MRI is often used to detect brain tumors because it shows the brain more clearly than do other imaging tests. Often a dye is injected into a vein in the arm before an MRI. The dye makes clearer pictures. This makes it easier to see smaller tumors. It can help your health care team see the difference between a brain tumor and healthy brain tissue. Sometimes you need a special type of MRI to create more-detailed pictures. One example is functional MRI. This special MRI shows which parts of the brain control speaking, moving and other important tasks. This helps your health care provider plan surgery and other treatments. Another special MRI test is magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This test uses MRI to measure levels of certain chemicals in the tumor cells. Having too much or too little of the chemicals might tell your health care team about the kind of brain tumor you have. Magnetic resonance perfusion is another special type of MRI. This test uses MRI to measure the amount of blood in different parts of the brain tumor. The parts of the tumor that have a higher amount of blood may be the most active parts of the tumor. Your health care team uses this information to plan your treatment. PET scan of the brain. A positron emission tomography scan, also called a PET scan, can detect some brain tumors. A PET scan uses a radioactive tracer that's injected into a vein. The tracer travels through the blood and attaches to brain tumor cells. The tracer makes the tumor cells stand out on the pictures taken by the PET machine. Cells that are dividing and multiplying quickly will take up more of the tracer. A PET scan may be most helpful for detecting brain tumors that are growing quickly. Examples include glioblastomas and some oligodendrogliomas. Brain tumors that grow slowly might not be detected on a PET scan. Brain tumors that aren't cancerous tend to grow more slowly, so PET scans are less useful for benign brain tumors. Not everyone with a brain tumor needs a PET scan. Ask your health care provider whether you need at PET scan. Collecting a sample of tissue. A brain biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of brain tumor tissue for testing in a lab. Often a surgeon gets the sample during surgery to remove the brain",

People who have broken heart syndrome often have higher levels of substances called cardiac enzymes in the blood. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick test measures the electrical activity of the heart. Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which shows the test results. An ECG shows how fast or how slow the heart is beating. ECG results for broken heart syndrome look different from those for a heart attack. Coronary angiogram. This test checks for blockages in the heart arteries. It's done to rule out a heart attack. People with broken heart syndrome often don't have any blockages. A doctor inserts a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist.

    "disease": "Burning mouth syndrome",
    "diagnosis": "There's no one test that can tell if you have burning mouth syndrome. Instead, your health care team will try to rule out other problems before diagnosing burning mouth syndrome.Your health care provider or dentist likely will: Review your medical history and medicines. Examine your mouth. Ask you to describe your symptoms. Discuss your habits and routine for keeping your teeth and mouth clean. Also, your health care provider will likely do a medical exam, looking for signs of other conditions. You may have some of the following tests: Blood tests. These tests can check your complete blood count, blood sugar level, thyroid function, nutritional factors and how well your immune system works. Test results may give clues about the source of your mouth discomfort. Oral cultures or biopsies. A cotton swab is used to get a sample for an oral culture. This can tell if you have a fungal, bacterial or viral infection in your mouth. For a biopsy, tiny pieces of tissue are taken from your mouth and sent to a lab to look at the cells. Allergy tests. Your provider may suggest allergy testing to see if you may be allergic to certain foods, additives, or even dental materials or mouth care products. Salivary measurements. With burning mouth syndrome, your mouth may feel dry. Salivary tests can tell if you have a reduced salivary flow. Gastric reflux tests. These tests can tell if stomach acid flows back into your mouth from your stomach. Imaging. Your provider may recommend an MRI, a CT scan or other imaging tests to check for other health problems. Medicine change. If you take a medicine that may cause mouth discomfort, your provider may change the dose or switch to a different medicine. Another option is to stop the medicine for a short time, if possible, to see if your discomfort goes away. Don't try this on your own because it can be dangerous to stop some medicines. Mental health questions. You may be asked to answer a series of questions that can help decide if you have symptoms of depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions that may be linked to burning mouth syndrome.

A scope or camera that sees inside your body. Your doctor may use a long, thin tube equipped with a lens or camera to examine areas inside your body. An endoscopy, which involves passing a scope down your throat, may help your doctor see inside your gastrointestinal tract. A bronchoscopy, using a scope passed down your throat and into your lungs, can help find lung carcinoid tumors. Passing a scope through your rectum (colonoscopy) can help diagnose rectal carcinoid tumors. To see inside your small intestine, your doctor may recommend a test using a pill-sized camera that you swallow (capsule endoscopy). Removing tissue for laboratory testing. A sample of tissue from the tumor (biopsy) may be collected to confirm your diagnosis. What type of biopsy you'll undergo depends on where your tumor is located. One way of collecting a tissue sample involves using a needle to draw cells out of the tumor. Another option may be through surgery.

If you have symptoms in that finger, you may have a condition other than carpal tunnel syndrome. Physical exam. Your healthcare professional tests the feeling in the fingers and the strength of the muscles in the hand. Bending the wrist, tapping on the nerve or simply pressing on the nerve can trigger symptoms in many people. X-ray. You may need an X-ray of the affected wrist to exclude other causes of wrist pain, such as arthritis or fracture. However, X-rays are not helpful in making a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Ultrasound. An ultrasound of the wrist provides a picture of the tendons and nerves. This can help show whether the nerve is being compressed. Electromyography. This test measures the tiny electrical discharges produced in muscles. During this test, a thin-needle electrode is inserted into specific muscles to evaluate the electrical activity when muscles contract and rest. This test can identify damage to the muscles controlled by the median nerve. The test also may rule out other conditions. Nerve conduction study. In a variation of electromyography, two electrodes are taped to the skin. A small shock is passed through the median nerve to see if electrical impulses are slowed in the carpal tunnel.

One eye is tested at a time, while the other eye is covered. A chart or a viewing device with letters that get smaller is used. With this, your eye doctor determines if you have 20/20 vision or if you have trouble seeing. Eye structure exam. An eye structure exam, also called a slit lamp, allows your eye doctor to see the structures at the front of your eye up close. It's called a slit lamp because it uses an intense line of light, a slit, to light up the structures in your eye. The slit allows your doctor to view these structures in small sections. This makes it easier to find anything that may be wrong. Retinal exam. A retinal exam looks at the back of your eyes, called the retina. To prepare for a retinal exam, your eye doctor puts drops in your eyes to open your pupils wide, called dilation. This makes it easier to see the retina. Using a slit lamp or a special device called an ophthalmoscope, your eye doctor can examine your lens for signs of a cataract. Fluid pressure test.

Capsule endoscopy camera Enlarge image Close Capsule endoscopy camera Capsule endoscopy camera A capsule endoscopy procedure involves swallowing a tiny camera that's about the size of a large vitamin pill. The capsule contains lights to light up the digestive system, a camera to take images and an antenna that sends those images to a recorder worn on a belt. Many people with celiac disease don't know they have it. Two blood tests can help diagnose it: Serology testing looks for antibodies in your blood. Elevated levels of certain antibody proteins indicate an immune reaction to gluten. Genetic testing for human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) can be used to rule out celiac disease. It's important to be tested for celiac disease before trying a gluten-free diet. Eliminating gluten from your diet might make the results of blood tests appear in the standard range.If the results of these tests indicate celiac disease, one of the following tests will likely be ordered: Endoscopy. This test uses a long tube with a tiny camera that's put into your mouth and passed down your throat. The camera enables the practitioner to view your small intestine and take a small tissue sample, called a biopsy, to analyze for damage to the villi. Capsule endoscopy. This test uses a tiny wireless camera to take pictures of your entire small intestine. The camera sits inside a vitamin-sized capsule, which you swallow.

    "diagnosis": "Cervical cancer FAQs Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about cervical cancer from Mayo Clinic gynecologic oncologist Kristina Butler, M.D., M.S. Show transcript for video Cervical cancer FAQs Hello. I'm Dr. Kristina Butler, a gynecologic oncologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you might have about cervical cancer. What is the right amount of time between Pap smears? Pap smear screenings begin at age 21 and continue, varying by age, every three to five years. What does it mean to have an abnormal Pap smear? Having an abnormal Pap smear is very common, so don't feel alone. It just means that additional tests are needed to prove that cervical cancer isn't present. Most people with abnormal Pap smear do not end up having a diagnosis of cervical cancer. What is the age cut off for the HPV vaccine? Most recently, the HPV vaccination has been increased to include all adults male and female to age 45. Should I still get the HPV vaccine if I already have cervical pre-cancer? Absolutely. After cervical pre-cancer or even HPV exposure, the vaccine remains to provide benefit. We have good evidence to support this. So I recommend HPV vaccination after pre-cancer or even after cervical cancer. Does catching cervical cancer early make a difference? Certainly, we aim to detect cervical cancer as early as possible. Early stage cervical cancer has much improved overall survival and reduced recurrence. Does cervical cancer impact fertility? Even though you've been diagnosed with cervical cancer, family planning is still possible. When diagnosed at early stages, we have fertility sparing treatment options that allow a woman to be treated for cervical cancer in some cases and continue to have fertility. How can I be the best partner to my medical team? I highly recommend having a medical team that you're comfortable communicating with. It's always safe to ask questions, get second opinions. And remember, at the end of the day, we're all here to help you on the same team. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish you well.",

A diagnosis is made based on the pattern of problems that are seen. The specific tests conducted during the evaluation depend on your child's age, ability to cooperate and the severity of the speech problem.It can sometimes be hard to diagnose CAS, especially when a child speaks very little or has trouble interacting with the speech-language pathologist.Still, it's important to identify whether your child shows symptoms of CAS because CAS is treated differently from other speech disorders. Your child's speech-language pathologist may be able to determine the best treatment approach for your child even if the diagnosis is not certain at first.Tests may include: Hearing tests. Your doctor may order hearing tests to determine if hearing problems could be contributing to your child's speech problems. Oral-motor assessment. Your child's speech-language pathologist will examine your child's lips, tongue, jaw and palate for structural problems, such as tongue-tie or a cleft palate. The speech-language pathologist also will look for other problems such as low muscle tone. Low muscle tone usually isn't associated with CAS, but it may be a sign of other conditions. Your child's speech-language pathologist will watch how your child moves his or her lips, tongue and jaw in activities such as blowing, smiling and kissing. Speech evaluation. Your child's ability to make sounds, words and sentences may be observed during play or other activities. Your child may be asked to name pictures. This allows the speech-language pathologist to check to see if your child has trouble making specific sounds or speaking certain words or syllables. Your child's speech-language pathologist also may evaluate your child's coordination and smoothness of movement in speech. Your child may be asked to repeat syllables such as \"pa-ta-ka\" or say words such as \"buttercup.\" If your child can speak sentences, the speech-language pathologist observes your child's melody and rhythm of speech. Melody and rhythm are heard in the way your child puts stress on syllables and words. Your child's speech-language pathologist may help your child by providing cues, such as saying the word or sound more slowly or providing touch cues to the face.A trial of speech therapy to observe how your child responds to CAS treatment can help the speech-language pathologist confirm CAS.

Severely obese — BMI greater than or equal to 120% of the 95th percentile. BMI doesn't take into account factors such as being muscular or having a larger than average body frame. What's more, growth patterns vary greatly among children. So, the healthcare professional also factors in your child's growth and development to help find out whether your child's weight is a health concern.Along with BMI and charting weight on the growth charts, the healthcare professional looks at: Your family's history of obesity and weight-related health conditions, such as diabetes. Your child's eating habits. This can include what your child eats and how often, and how big the portion sizes are. Your child's activity level and amount of screen time. Your child's blood pressure.

The rate of chlamydia infection is highest in this group, so a yearly screening test is recommended. Even if you've been tested in the past year, get tested when you have a new sex partner. Pregnant people. Chlamydia screening may be offered during the first prenatal exam. If you have a high risk of infection, get tested again later in your pregnancy. You are at high risk if you are younger than age 25, have a new sex partner or have a sex partner who might be infected. People at high risk. People who have new or multiple sex partners or men who have sex with men should consider more frequent chlamydia screening. Other markers of high risk are current infection with another sexually transmitted infection and possible exposure to an STI through an infected partner. Screening and diagnosis of chlamydia is relatively simple. You may be able to use a test that's available without a prescription, sometimes called an at-home test, to see if you have chlamydia. If that test shows you have chlamydia, you'll need to see a healthcare professional to confirm the diagnosis and start treatment.To determine whether you have chlamydia, your healthcare professional will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected with: A urine test. A sample of urine is analyzed in the laboratory for presence of this infection. This can be done for males and females. A swab. A sample from the cervix, vagina, throat or anus is collected on a swab for testing. From the cervix, a member of your healthcare team collects a sample of the discharge from the cervix on a swab for testing. This can be done during a routine Pap test.

If your doctor suspects cholangiocarcinoma, he or she may have you undergo one or more of the following tests: Liver function tests. Blood tests to measure your liver function can give your doctor clues about what's causing your signs and symptoms. Tumor marker test. Checking the level of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 in your blood may give your doctor additional clues about your diagnosis. CA 19-9 is a protein that's overproduced by bile duct cancer cells. A high level of CA 19-9 in your blood doesn't mean you have bile duct cancer, though. This result can also occur in other bile duct diseases, such as bile duct inflammation and obstruction. A test to examine your bile duct with a small camera. During endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a thin, flexible tube equipped with a tiny camera is passed down your throat and through your digestive tract to your small intestine. The camera is used to examine the area where your bile ducts connect to your small intestine. Your doctor may also use this procedure to inject dye into the bile ducts to help them show up better on imaging tests. Imaging tests. Imaging tests can help your doctor see your internal organs and look for signs of cholangiocarcinoma. Techniques used to diagnose bile duct cancer include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MRCP is increasingly being used as a noninvasive alternative to ERCP. It offers 3D images without the need for a dye to enhance the images. A procedure to remove a sample of tissue for testing. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of tissue for examination under a microscope. If the suspicious area is located very near where the bile duct joins the small intestine, your doctor may obtain a biopsy sample during ERCP. If the suspicious area is within or near the liver, your doctor may obtain a tissue sample by inserting a long needle through your skin to the affected area (fine-needle aspiration). He or she may use an imaging test, such as an endoscopic ultrasound or CT scan, to guide the needle to the precise area. How your doctor collects a biopsy sample may influence which treatment options are available to you later. For example, if your bile duct cancer is biopsied by fine-needle aspiration, you will become ineligible for liver transplantation. Don't hesitate to ask about your doctor's experience with diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion. If your doctor confirms a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, he or she tries to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer. Often this involves additional imaging tests. Your cancer's stage helps determine your prognosis and your treatment options. Care at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your cholangiocarc",

Show transcript for video Kidney disease FAQs Living with diabetes is difficult, thinking about what you eat. But controlling the sugar levels are really important for helping kidney function and specifically slowing down any damage to the kidneys. Newer drugs that have come out in the last couple years can help with this, as well as working with your primary care physician or endocrinologist with your current therapies to get better sugar control. We really want to help your health and so losing weight can be a key component to reducing your risk of progressing with kidney disease. Reducing calorie intake, which is either smaller portions, less snacking in between meals, and then thinking about burning calories with increasing your exercise, are great steps forward in starting that journey towards weight loss. We look to get blood pressure less than 130 systolic, that's the top number. And less than 80 diastolic, that's the bottom number, on blood pressure readings. There are a number of different drugs that we can use to do this. And this will help both with your cardiovascular health, but slowing down any kidney disease progression over time as well. There are two different types of dialysis: hemodialysis, which is done through cleaning the blood through a machine, which you attend a dialysis center three times a week for about four hours each time. It can be done at home in certain circumstances. Or peritoneal dialysis, where fluid gets put into your tummy, takes out the toxins and is drained. And that can be done either during the day or overnight on a machine. The benefits and risks of these are individualized, as some people are able to do the treatment at home or need to go to a treatment center for this. It also depends on your location and how close the nearest dialysis centers are. The kidney transplant works in the same way as your own kidneys do, with the blood coming through the transplant, filtering it and the urine coming out. The kidney transplant is protected by the anti-rejection medication, so your body doesn't attack it. And we leave your own kidneys in because they eventually shrivel down and don't function anymore. You don't want more surgery than you need. For a kidney transplant at the moment, taking anti-rejection drugs is an everyday, lifelong occurrence. These can come with side effects. But current research is looking to try and minimize or come off anti-rejection drugs with specific research protocols at the moment. We really want to partner with you to get the best outcomes for you, so that chronic kidney disease doesn't affect you as much as it can. Controlling your blood pressure and therefore monitoring that at home, taking your medications regularly, and letting us know about side effects is a really important part in partnering and helping you to have a good quality of life living with chronic kidney disease.

Show transcript for video Cirrhosis FAQs [Music playing] Ask Mayo Clinic: Cirrhosis Sumera I. Ilyas, M.B.B.S., Transplant Hepatologist, Mayo Clinic Hi, I'm Dr. Sumera Ilyas, a transplant hepatologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about cirrhosis. Can I still drink alcohol with liver disease? No amount of alcohol is considered safe in patients with cirrhosis. They should avoid all alcohol use. Are pain medications safe to take with liver disease? Well, some pain medications are safe to take in certain doses, and some are not. For instance, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, they should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis, because when the liver is scarred, there's a greater chance of hurting the kidneys with these types of medications. Narcotics such as oxycodone are not a good idea either as they can be quite problematic with certain complications of cirrhosis. Acetaminophen, on the other hand, is safe to take, but at smaller doses. For pain relief in cirrhosis, we recommend taking acetaminophen up to two grams a day. So that's four extra strength tablets within a 24-hour period. How can diet help manage my cirrhosis? So it's important to eat an overall healthy diet that is balanced and full of fruits and vegetables. It's important to have protein intake, and that can be from lean sources of protein such as beans or lentils, and salt restriction is also very important. Limit the amount of salt in your diet to less than two grams of total intake a day. Will taking supplements help my cirrhosis? Although certain herbal supplements such as milk thistle have been tried in liver disease, there's no evidence to suggest that herbal supplements or any other alternative therapies can effectively treat cirrhosis. However, there is a chance of herbal supplements causing harm to the liver, sometimes to the point of liver failure requiring a liver transplant. So we recommend avoiding any and all herbal supplements. Why are vaccines important with cirrhosis? Well, vaccinations are an important preventive measure in patients with cirrhosis because when the liver is scarred, patients are at higher risk of complications from certain infections. For patients with cirrhosis, we recommend vaccination against hepatitis A and B. We also recommend the pneumococcal vaccine, which is commonly referred to as the pneumonia vaccine, for all adult patients with cirrhosis. And patients with cirrhosis should also get the annual flu shot. How can I slow or reverse cirrhosis? There are instances when damage to the liver can be slowed although complete reversal generally does not happen. For example, if a patient has cirrhosis due to alcohol use, we know that completely abstaining from alcohol can improve the function of the liver. Similarly, weight loss can help improve fatty liver disease. And cirrhosis from hepatitis C was a major reason patients required liver transplants, but we now have medications, antiviral drugs, that are very effective at curing it. There's evidence to suggest that getting rid of the hepatitis C can slow or maybe even help reverse some of the damage done. But there are instances when the liver disease is too advanced and medical interventions cannot reverse the process and that's when we consider liver transplantation. How can I be the best partner to my medical team? We know that this is tough for our patients and their loved ones and we want to do everything we can to make the process seamless for our patients. It's helpful for us if we have as much information about your condition as possible--any prior medical therapies, any new symptoms or signs, any medications, herbal supplements or any other medical conditions that you may have.

How often headaches come and how long they last also are important.For cluster headache, a specialist trained in treating headaches (neurologist) makes a diagnosis on medical history, symptoms, and a physical and neurological examination.For people with unusual or complicated headaches, tests to rule out other causes for the pain might include: An MRI scan. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and blood vessels. MRI scans help diagnose tumors, strokes, bleeding in the brain, infections, and other brain and nervous system conditions. Conditions that affect the brain and nervous system are also known as neurological conditions. A CT scan. A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a series of X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the brain. This helps diagnose tumors, infections, brain damage, bleeding in the brain and other possible medical problems that may be causing headaches.

    "disease": "Colon polyps",
    "diagnosis": "Screening tests are important in finding polyps before they become cancerous. These tests also can help find colorectal cancer in its early stages, when you have a good chance of recovery.Screening methods include: Colonoscopy, in which a small tube with a light and camera is inserted into the rectum to look at the colon. If polyps are found, a healthcare professional may remove them right away or take tissue samples to send to a lab for analysis. Virtual colonoscopy, a test that uses a CT scan to view the colon. Virtual colonoscopy requires the same bowel preparation as a colonoscopy. If a polyp is found during the scan, you'll need to repeat the bowel preparation for a colonoscopy to have the polyp examined and removed. Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Like a colonoscopy, this uses a small tube with a light and camera but examines just the last third of the colon. Most of the colon is not seen with this screening test, so some polyps and cancers may not be found. When this test is used, it is repeated more often than colonoscopy or is used along with an annual stool-based test. Stool-based tests. There are a few of these tests available. One of these checks for blood in the stool and needs to be repeated every year. Another test checks for blood and tumor markers in the stool to look for colon polyps or colorectal cancer and is repeated every three years. If any of the stool-based tests are positive, a colonoscopy is recommended soon afterward.

He says you might be surprised how often colonoscopies uncover polyps lurking in your colon. \"Precancerous polyps are extremely common,\" he says. \"We expect to find them in more than a quarter of the colonoscopies that we do at a minimum. So, you know, maybe a third or even a half of all patients getting [a] colonoscopy will have precancerous polyps.\" Although 1 in 20 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in his or her lifetime, Dr. Kisiel says having polyps does not necessarily mean you will get cancer. \"Of all the polyps that we see, only a minority will turn into cancer,\" he says. \"Sometimes they just go away on their own, but removing polyps is thought to be one of the mechanisms by which we can prevent the formation of cancer in the first place.\" That's why regular screening is so important. The downside is that if a polyp is found in your colon, you may have to get screened more frequently. But that's certainly better than having to go through treatment for colorectal cancer.

    "diagnosis": "Congenital heart defects FAQs Pediatric cardiologist Jonathan Johnson, M.D., answers the most frequently asked questions about congenital heart defects in children. Show transcript for video Congenital heart defects FAQs Some very minor forms of congenital heart disease, like very small holes in the heart or very mild stenosis of different heart valves may just need to be followed every couple of years with some sort of an imaging study like an echocardiogram. Other more significant forms of congenital heart disease may require surgery that could be done via an open heart surgery, or it could be done in the cardiac catheterization lab using different devices or different techniques. In certain very severe situations, if surgery can't be performed, transplant may be indicated. The specific symptoms that a child may have if they have congenital heart disease are really dependent on the age of the child. For infants, their biggest source of caloric expenditure is actually while eating. And thus most signs of congenital heart disease or heart failure actually come when they're eating. This can include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or even sweating while they're feeding. Younger children will often present with symptoms related to their abdominal system. They may have nausea, vomiting with eating, and they may get those symptoms with activity as well. Older teenagers meanwhile, tend to present more symptoms such as chest pain, fainting or palpitations. They also may present with symptoms during exercise or activity. And that's actually a really big red flag for me as a cardiologist. If I hear about a child, especially a teenager who's had chest pain, or has fainted with activity or with exercise, I really need to see that child and I need to make sure that they get an appropriate workup. Often when your child has just been diagnosed with congenital heart disease, it's hard to remember everything that was said to you at that first visit. You can be in shock having just heard this news. And oftentimes you may not remember everything. So it's important in the follow-up visits to ask these types of questions. What do my next five years look like? Are there any procedures that are going to be needed in those five years? Any surgeries? What type of testing, what type of follow-up, what type of clinic visits are going to be needed? What does this mean for my child's activities, athletics, and the different things that they want to do on a daily basis. And most importantly, how do we work together to make this child be able to have as normal of a life possible despite that diagnosis of congenital heart disease. You should ask your doctor what type of procedures may be needed for this form of congenital heart disease in the future. They may be performed using open-heart surgery, or they could be done using cardiac catheterization. For open-heart surgery, it's important to ask your doctor about the timing of that surgery. For the different, specific types of congenital heart disease, there is actually certain times where it's better to do the surgery than others to have the best possible outcome, both short- and long-term for that child. So ask your doctor if there's a particular time that works better for that particular disease and for your child. This is actually the most common question I get from parents and from children after we make a diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Athletics is so important to many of these child's lives, to their friendship groups and how they interact with their communities. In most forms of congenital heart disease, we do our best to try to figure out a way that they can still participate. There are some forms of congenital heart disease, however, where certain sports may not be advised. For instance, for some of our patients, they may have a certain type of a genetic syndrome that makes the walls of their arteries very weak. And those patients, w",

Your doctor may also order tests to exclude other conditions with similar symptoms.The following tests can help diagnose a congenital myasthenic syndrome and determine how severe the disorder is. Blood tests. A blood test might reveal the presence of abnormal antibodies that disrupt signals between your nerves and your muscles. Other blood tests may be helpful to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Electromyography (EMG). EMG is a diagnostic procedure to assess the health of muscles and the nerve cells that control them, called motor neurons. EMG results can reveal nerve dysfunction, muscle dysfunction or problems with signal transmission between the nerves and muscles. Repetitive nerve stimulation. In this nerve conduction study, electrodes are attached to your skin over the muscles to be tested. Small pulses of electricity are sent through the electrodes to measure the nerve's ability to send a signal to your muscle. The nerve is tested repeatedly to see if its ability to send signals worsens with fatigue. Genetic testing. This can identify the specific affected gene that's responsible for the congenital myasthenic syndrome and which treatments may be beneficial. Cholinesterase challenge test. Cholinesterase inhibitor medication, such as pyridostigmine, is given to determine if improvement in muscle fatigue occurs with repetitive movement. Other tests. These may include lung function tests to assess breathing and oxygenation, a sleep study to assess breathing and apnea during sleep, or a muscle biopsy to look at muscle fibers.",

Show transcript for video Coronary artery disease FAQs Hi, I'm Dr. Steve Kopecky, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic. And I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about coronary artery disease. Many small changes can lead to great benefit over time. Remember that nothing you do to improve your health is ever too little. And nothing you do to improve your health is ever too late. Cholesterol is always involved in the initiation of the narrowing of the arteries to the heart. And every plaque or narrowing of your arteries contains cholesterol. It is essential to control the cholesterol in order to optimally lower your chance of a heart attack. Yes. All the studies that have shown regression of arterial narrowing have done three things. First, take care of the obvious factors like high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol. Second, address diet and physical activity. And third, help patients manage stress. No. Half of the time, the first symptom a person has of coronary artery disease is actually a heart attack. And half of these heart attacks are fatal. So overall, for one out of four people, the first symptom is what we term sudden cardiac death. No. Studies have shown that even if your cholesterol is well control with medicines, if you do not eat a healthy diet, your heart attack, stroke, and death rate is not significantly reduced. Yes. Since your heart beats one hundred thousand times a day, even mild elevations of blood pressure above 130 over 80 can cause significant health problems, including heart attacks, strokes and heart failure. I tell people they have a new part-time job called Your Health. In part of this is knowing what medicines you're on, what doses you're taking and why you're taking these medicines. Also very helpful, check your blood pressure regularly. Check your weight regularly at home. If any questions arise about your health, put them in your smartphone, so you'll have them the next time you have your visit with your doctor. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish you well. To diagnose coronary artery disease, a healthcare professional examines you. You are usually asked questions about your medical history and any symptoms. If you have symptoms of coronary artery disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath, tests may be done to check your overall health.",

Let them know if you've had close contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19.In the United States, at-home COVID-19 tests are available. Free tests can be mailed to U.S. addresses, or you can purchase tests in stores, pharmacies or online. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also known as the FDA, approves or authorizes the tests. On the FDA website, you can find a list of the tests that are validated and their expiration dates. You also can check with your healthcare professional before buying a test if you have any concerns.When taking a test at home, read the directions that come with the test carefully. Follow the instructions exactly to get as accurate a result as possible.COVID-19 tests also are available from healthcare professionals, some pharmacies and clinics, or at community testing sites.Here are some guidelines for when to take a COVID-19 test: If you have COVID-19 symptoms, test for the illness right away. If you were exposed to the COVID-19 virus but don't have symptoms, wait at least five days after exposure then test. If you have symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 30 days, you can test again. But if you were just exposed to the coronavirus and don't have symptoms, you don't need to test. Also, testing before an event or contact with people at high risk of serious illness helps prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.COVID-19 tests use a sample taken from your nose or throat, or a sample of saliva.Two types of tests can help diagnose COVID-19. Molecular tests. These tests look for genetic material from the COVID-19 virus. Polymerase chain reaction tests, shortened to PCR tests, are molecular tests. You may also see this type of test called an NAAT test, short for nucleic acid amplification test. PCR tests are more accurate than the other type of COVID-19 test, called an antigen test. PCR tests may be done at home. But they are much more likely to be done by a healthcare professional and processed in a lab. Antigen tests. These tests look for viral proteins called antigens. Antigen tests also may be called rapid COVID-19 tests or at-home COVID-19 tests. These tests are useful if you need a quick result. Antigen tests are reliable and accurate, but they are less accurate than PCR tests. This is especially true if you don't have symptoms. If you take an antigen test and are negative for COVID-19, take another antigen test after 48 hours to get the most accurate result.",

    "disease": "Cushing syndrome",
    "diagnosis": "Taking glucocorticoid medicines is the most common way to get Cushing syndrome. Your health care provider can look at all your medicines — pills, injections, creams and inhalers — to see if you're taking medicines that can cause the syndrome. If you are, you won't need other tests.When Cushing syndrome is caused by the body making too much cortisol, it can be hard to diagnose. That's because other illnesses have similar symptoms. Diagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and complex process. You'll need to see a doctor who specializes in hormonal diseases, called an endocrinologist.The endocrinologist likely will do a physical exam and look for signs of Cushing syndrome, such as a round face, a hump on the back of the neck, and thin, bruised skin with stretch marks.If you haven't been using a glucocorticoid medicine, these tests may help pinpoint the cause of Cushing syndrome: Urine and blood tests. These tests measure hormone levels and show if the body is making too much cortisol. For the urine test, you may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Cortisol, ACTH and other hormones are be measured in urine and blood samples. Your health care provider also might recommend other tests. These tests measure cortisol levels before and after using hormone medicines to trigger or block cortisol. Saliva test. Cortisol levels typically rise and fall during the day. In people without Cushing syndrome, cortisol drops in the evening. By looking at cortisol levels from a small sample of saliva collected at night, the health care team can see if cortisol levels are too high. Imaging tests. CT or MRI scans can take pictures of the pituitary and adrenal glands to see if anything shows up, such as tumors. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling. This test can help decide if Cushing syndrome is caused by an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma, or ACTH-producing tumor in another organ. For the test, blood samples are taken from the veins that drain the pituitary gland, called the inferior petrosal sinuses. During the test, you are given medicine through a vein to help you stay calm and comfortable. A thin tube is placed in your groin or neck area and is threaded to the inferior petrosal sinuses to collect a blood sample. Another blood sample is taken from your forearm. You are then given a medicine that causes the tumor to make more ACTH, and blood samples are taken again from the same areas. Levels of ACTH are then compared between the two sample areas. If the ACTH level is higher in the sinus sample, the problem is coming from the pituitary. If the ACTH levels are similar between the sinuses and forearm, the problem is outside of the pituitary gland. These tests help your health care provider diagnose Cushing syndrome. They also may help rule out other health conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome — a hormone problem in people with enlarged ovaries. Depression, eating disorders and alcoholism also can have symptoms similar to Cushing syndrome.

    "diagnosis": "Cystic fibrosis FAQs Pulmonologist Sarah Chalmers, M.D., answers the most frequently asked questions about cystic fibrosis. Show transcript for video Cystic fibrosis FAQs Hello. I'm Dr. Sarah Chalmers, a pulmonologist at Mayo Clinic. And I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about cystic fibrosis. Just because your baby's newborn screen came back positive does not mean that your baby has cystic fibrosis. Most babies who have a positive screening actually don't have CF. The newborn screen looks at a substance in the blood that is elevated in cystic fibrosis, but it can be elevated in other conditions as well, even premature birth. Some states also test for a gene mutation, but even if this comes back positive, it doesn't mean your baby has the disease. People with only one mutation are called carriers. It's very common in the United States and one in 20 people are CF gene mutation carriers. If your baby has a positive cystic fibrosis screen, they will need to see their doctor and have a sweat chloride test to see if they do have cystic fibrosis. CF gene mutations are actually passed from parent to children in a specific pattern called autosomal recessive. Each parent passes one CF gene to their child, and therefore each person has two CF genes. To get the disease, both genes have to have a mutation. People with one CF gene are called carriers. If a parent is a carrier, there's a 50 percent chance they'll pass on the gene with a mutation to their child. If both parents pass on a normal gene, or only one parent passes a gene with a mutation, the child will not have CF. If both parents pass on a gene with a mutation, then the baby will have two genes with the mutation and will likely get the disease. If both parents are CF mutation carriers, there's a 25 percent chance that each one of their babies will be born with cystic fibrosis. So both males and females can get cystic fibrosis. But females tend to have more symptoms, more lung infections, and they tend to start these symptoms of infections earlier in life as compared to males. No one knows for sure why this is so. Actually, nearly 10 percent of cases of CF are diagnosed in adulthood. You're born with cystic fibrosis, but there are several reasons why it may not be diagnosed during childhood. Prior to 2010, some states didn't even screen for cystic fibrosis. So if you were born before 2010, you may not have received a newborn screening test for cystic fibrosis as a baby. Some gene mutations cause very mild disease and symptoms may go unnoticed until adulthood. CF symptoms, how the disease affects the patient's organs and how it impacts their life is very different from one person to the next. Some people have very mild disease with only one organ affected and very few symptoms, while others have more severe disease with troublesome symptoms and multiple organs that are affected. Many factors including gene mutation type determine the impact on the patient. But your cystic fibrosis care team can work with you as an individual patient to create a personalized treatment plan that meets your individual needs. Fertility is affected in both men and women with cystic fibrosis. Women with CF have thicker cervical mucus and they may also have irregular menstrual cycles. So it may take longer for women with CF to become pregnant. But most can become pregnant, have a normal pregnancy and a normal delivery. Almost all men with CF have infertility. Men with CF make normal sperm, but the sperm canal is absent. Because they still make sperm, assisted reproductive technologies can be used to help male CF patients have biologic children. Whether your children get CF or not depends on the combination of genes passed on from you and your significant other and can range from zero chance if neither parent has a gene mutation to a near 100% chance if both parents have CF. Always be honest with your health care team. Let us kno",

    "diagnosis": "Type 1 diabetes FAQs Endocrinologist Yogish Kudva, M.B.B.S., answers the most frequently asked questions about type 1 diabetes. Show transcript for video Type 1 diabetes FAQs Hi, I'm Dr. Yogish C Kudva. I'm an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about type one diabetes. The best current treatment for type one diabetes is an automated insulin delivery system. This system includes a continuous glucose monitor, insulin pump, and a computer algorithm that continually adjusts insulin responding to the continuous glucose monitoring signal. The patient still has to enter information about the amount of carbohydrate he or she eats at mealtimes to provide the meal time related insulin. Testing using a glucose meter is not enough because glucose measurements in people with type one diabetes, vary from normal to low and normal to high very rapidly in the course of a day, a continuous glucose monitor is needed to assess whether treatment is effective and also to determine how to improve treatment. Current guidelines recommend use of a continuous glucose monitor. The percentage of time that is spent daily with glucose between 70 and 180 milligram per deciliter is the main measurement of appropriate treatment. This percentage should be 70% or higher daily. In addition, percentage of time spent with glucose below 70 should be less than four percent and greater than 250 should be less than five percent. Clearly, hemoglobin A1C testing to evaluate adequacy of treatment is not enough. In certain people with type one diabetes transplantation can be undertaken. This could be pancreas transplantation or transplantation of insulin making cells called islet. Islet transplantation is considered research in the US. Pancreas transplantation is available as a clinical treatment. These patients with hypoglycemia unawareness may benefit from a pancreas transplant. People with type one diabetes who develop recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis may also benefit from a pancreas transplant. People with type one diabetes who have developed kidney failure, could have their lives transformed by transplantation of both the pancreas and the kidney. There is active research going on to prevent type one diabetes from happening in children and adults who are less than 45 years old. People who are eligible for such research studies are people who have a positive antibody test for type one diabetes and are willing to be in such studies. The treatment being tested is medication that suppresses the immune system. Willing participants would be randomized to receive immune suppressive treatment or placebo treatment. Placebo looks like the medication, but does not do the same thing in the body. Initial research studies have been successful in decreasing the risk of development of type one diabetes in people that have received the immune system suppressing treatment and therefore, larger studies are now being undertaken. Try to be informed about research going on and treatments that may be approved for type one diabetes. You can get this information through already available publications. Make sure that at least annually you see a physician who is an expert on your disorder. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish well. Type 1 diabetes symptoms often start suddenly and are often the reason for checking blood sugar levels. Because symptoms of other types of diabetes and prediabetes come on more gradually or may not be easy to see, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has developed screening guidelines. The ADA recommends that the following people be screened for diabetes: Anyone with a body mass index higher than 25 (23 for Asian Americans), regardless of age, who has additional risk factors. These factors include high blood pressure, non-typical ch",

During the test, your health care provider measures changes in your body weight, how much urine your body makes, and the concentration of your urine and blood. Your health care provider also may measure the amount of ADH in your blood. During this test, you may receive a manufactured form of ADH. That can help show if your body is making enough ADH and if your kidneys can respond as expected to ADH. Urine test. Testing urine to see if it contains too much water can be helpful in identifying diabetes insipidus. Blood tests. Checking the levels of certain substances in the blood, such as sodium, potassium and calcium, can help with a diagnosis and may be useful in identifying the type of diabetes insipidus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI can look for problems with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. This imaging test uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the brain. Genetic testing. If other people in your family have had problems with too much urination or have been diagnosed with diabetes insipidus, your health care provider may suggest genetic testing.

The biopsy needle is put through the skin to the kidney. The procedure often uses an imaging device, such as an ultrasound transducer, to guide the needle. Diabetic nephropathy usually is diagnosed during the regular testing that's part of managing diabetes. Get tested every year if you have type 2 diabetes or have had type 1 diabetes for more than five years.Routine screening tests may include: Urinary albumin test. This test can detect a blood protein called albumin in urine. Typically, the kidneys don't filter albumin out of the blood. Too much albumin in your urine can mean that the kidneys aren't working well. Albumin/creatinine ratio. Creatinine is a chemical waste product that healthy kidneys filter out of the blood. The albumin/creatinine ratio measures how much albumin compared to creatinine is in a urine sample. It shows how well the kidneys are working. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The measure of creatinine in a blood sample may be used to see how quickly the kidneys filter blood. This is called the glomerular filtration rate. A low rate means the kidneys aren't working well. Other diagnostic tests may include: Imaging tests. X-rays and ultrasound can show the makeup and size of the kidneys. CT and MRI scans can show how well blood is moving within the kidneys. You may need other imaging tests, as well. Kidney biopsy. This is a procedure to take a sample of kidney tissue to be studied in a lab. It involves a numbing medicine called a local anesthetic. A thin needle is used to remove small pieces of kidney tissue.

You may need imaging tests such as an MRI or a CT scan right away if your healthcare professional thinks you might be having or may have had a stroke. You also may need one of these imaging tests if you are older or had a blow to the head.Your healthcare professional asks you about your symptoms and the medicines you take. Then you'll likely have a physical exam. During this exam, your healthcare professional checks how you walk and maintain your balance. The major nerves of your central nervous system also are checked to make sure they're working.You also may need a hearing test and balance tests, including: Eye movement testing. Your healthcare professional may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which water or air is placed in your ear canal. Head movement testing. If your vertigo may be caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), your healthcare professional may do a simple head movement test. It's called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, and it can confirm that you have BPPV. Posturography. This test tells your healthcare professional which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand barefoot on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. Rotary chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. You also may be given blood tests to check for infection. You may need other tests to check your heart and blood vessel health too.More InformationMRI",

    "disease": "Double uterus",
    "diagnosis": "A double uterus may be diagnosed during a routine pelvic exam. Your doctor may observe a double cervix or feel an unusually shaped uterus. To confirm the diagnosis of double uterus, you may need certain tests: Ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the inside of your body. To capture the images, a device called a transducer is pressed against the outside of your lower belly. Or you may have the transducer put into your vagina. This is called transvaginal ultrasound. You may need both types of ultrasound to get the best view. A 3D ultrasound may be used, if it's available at your facility. Sonohysterogram. The sonohysterogram (son-o-HIS-ter-o-gram) is a special type of ultrasound scan. You have fluid injected through a tube into your uterus. The fluid outlines the shape of your uterus on the ultrasound scan. This allows your doctor to look for anything unusual. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI machine looks like a tunnel that has both ends open. You lie down on a movable table that slides into the opening of the tunnel. This painless test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of the inside of your body. Hysterosalpingography. During a hysterosalpingography (his-tur-o-sal-ping-GOG-ruh-fe), a special dye is injected into your uterus through your cervix. As the dye moves through your reproductive organs, X-rays are taken. These images show the shape and size of your uterus. They also show if your fallopian tubes are open.

A sound called a pericardial rub can happen when the pericardium is inflamed or when fluid has collected around the heart.Tests that can help find out if you have Dressler syndrome include: Complete blood count. Most people with Dressler syndrome have an increased white blood cell count. Blood tests to measure inflammation. A blood test can check the level of C-reactive protein made by the liver. A higher level of this protein can be a sign of inflammation that's linked with Dressler syndrome. Another blood test called erythrocyte sedimentation rate measures how fast red blood cells sink to the bottom of a test tube. When they sink fast, it can be a sign of more inflammation. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick test checks the electrical activity of the heart. It shows how the heart is beating. Sticky patches called electrodes attach to the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer that prints or displays the test results. Certain changes in the heart's electrical signals can be a sign of pressure on the heart. But these changes can happen after heart surgery, so the results of other tests are needed to confirm whether you have Dressler syndrome. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can help detect fluid around the heart or lungs. It also can help find out if the fluid is caused by a different condition, such as pneumonia. Echocardiogram. Sound waves make an image of the heart to show if fluid is collecting around it. Cardiac MRI. This test uses sound waves to create still or moving pictures of how blood flows through the heart.

In some cases, disproportionate dwarfism may be suspected during a prenatal ultrasound if very short limbs in relation to the trunk are noted.Diagnostic tests may include: Measurements. A regular part of a well-baby medical exam is the measurement of height, weight and head size. At each visit, your pediatrician plots these measurements on a chart to show your child's current percentile ranking for each one. This is important for identifying growth that isn't typical, such as delayed growth or a large head in relation to the rest of the body. If any trends in these charts are a concern, your child's pediatrician may take measurements more often. Appearance. Many distinct facial and skeletal features are related to each of several dwarfism conditions. How your child looks also may help your pediatrician and geneticist make a diagnosis. Imaging technology. Your healthcare professional may order imaging studies, such as X-rays, because certain differences in the skull and skeleton can indicate which condition your child may have. Various imaging devices also may reveal delayed maturation of bones, as is the case when growth hormone levels are low. An MRI scan may show if the pituitary gland or hypothalamus is not typical. Genetic tests. Genetic tests are available for many genetic causes of dwarfism-related conditions. Your doctor may suggest a test to confirm the diagnosis. This test could help manage the condition and aid in family planning. For example, if your doctor thinks your daughter may have Turner syndrome, a special lab test may be done that looks at the X chromosomes in blood cells. Family history.

Vision, hearing and brain (neurological) tests. These can help determine whether another disorder may be causing or adding to your child's difficulty reading. Psychological evaluation. The provider may ask you and your child questions to better understand your child's mental health. This can help determine whether social problems, anxiety or depression may be limiting your child's abilities. Tests for reading and other academic skills. Your child may take a set of educational tests and have the process and quality of reading skills analyzed by a reading expert.",

    "disease": "Dysphagia",
    "diagnosis": "A member of your healthcare team will likely ask you for a description and history of your swallowing difficulties, perform a physical exam, and use various tests to find the cause of your swallowing problem.Tests can include: X-ray with a contrast material, called a barium X-ray. You drink a barium solution that coats the esophagus, making it easier to see on X-rays. A healthcare team can then see changes in the shape of the esophagus and can check the muscular activity. You also may be asked to swallow solid food or a pill coated with barium. This allows the healthcare team to watch the muscles in the throat during swallowing or to look for blockages in the esophagus that the liquid barium solution might not show. Dynamic swallowing study. This study involves swallowing barium-coated foods of different consistencies. It provides an image of these foods as they travel down the throat. The images might show problems in the coordination of the mouth and throat muscles during swallowing. The images also can show if food is going into the breathing tube. Endoscopy. Endoscopy involves passing a thin, flexible lighted instrument, called an endoscope, down the throat. This allows your healthcare team to see your esophagus. Tissue samples, called biopsies, may be collected. The samples are studied to look for inflammation, eosinophilic esophagitis, narrowing or a tumor. Fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). During a FEES study, a healthcare professional examines the throat with an endoscope during swallowing. Esophageal muscle test, called manometry. In manometry (muh-NOM-uh-tree), a small tube is inserted into the esophagus and connected to a pressure recorder to measure the muscle contractions of the esophagus during swallowing. Imaging scans. These can include a CT scan or an MRI scan. A CT scan combines a series of X-ray views and computer processing to create cross-sectional images of the body's bones and soft tissues. An MRI scan uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues.

I'm Carrie. I'm a speech pathologist. I'm going to be helping out with the evaluation today. We're going to be doing a type of swallowing evaluation where we put a camera in your nose. We give you different consistencies of food items to swallow and watch you swallow those. This is the camera we're going to use. It goes in your nose about this far, just a little bit past that white line. There's not much space between your nose and your throat, so it doesn't have to go in very far. We're not in there very long. Just long enough to take a look around at the anatomy, give you a couple of things to eat and drink, watch you swallow those and then we come out, okay. So the different items we're going to be swallowing. We'd like to do an assortment of consistencies, so we do a thin liquid, a puree, and then a solid consistency. I put a little green food coloring in the liquid and the puree that just allows us to see it better when the cameras in place. Okay. Proceduralist: Ready? Assistant: Some slow deep breaths. Carrie: That's the absolute worst part right there. Assistant: Good job. Proceduralist: Can you see? Assistant: Can you see on the TV? Carrie: Only if you want. Proceduralist: We can show you afterwards too. Carrie: Ready for me? Assistant: Take a couple sips of juice. Carrie: Go ahead and take a couple more for me. Good. Assistant: Some applesau",

    "diagnosis": "Endometriosis FAQs Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about endometriosis from Megan Wasson, D.O., a minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon at Mayo Clinic. Show transcript for video Endometriosis FAQs Hi, I'm Dr. Megan Wasson, a minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon at Mayo Clinic. I'm here to answer some of the important questions that you might have about endometriosis. What causes endometriosis? I wish I could tell you the answer to that, but unfortunately, we don't know. Currently, we think that the likely source of endometriosis is actually occurring during development as a fetus. So when a baby is developing inside the uterus of its mother, that's when we think endometriosis actually starts. How do I know if I have endometriosis? That's a really great question. So endometriosis is something that can be a little bit elusive, but we can suspect it based on symptoms that you might be experiencing. If you're having pain with your periods, pain in your pelvis in general pain with intercourse, urination, bowel movements, all of that may point us to a suspicion of endometriosis. But unfortunately, the only way to say 100% If you do or do not have endometriosis is to do surgery. Because during surgery we can remove tissue, look at it underneath the microscope, and definitively be able to say whether you do or do not have endometriosis. Can endometriosis be seen on imaging? Unfortunately, most of the time, no. The vast majority of endometriosis is superficial endometriosis, meaning that it's almost like paint spackling on a wall, that we can't see it unless we actually go in and take a look surgically. The exception to that is if there's endometriosis actually growing into organs in the pelvis or the abdomen like the bowel or the bladder. That's called deep-infiltrating endometriosis. In those scenarios, we can frequently see that disease either on ultrasound or on MRI. If I have endometriosis, should I have a hysterectomy? Not necessarily. So endometriosis, it's cells similar to the lining of the uterus that are growing outside of the uterus. So it's truly not an issue with the uterus at all, which is what we treat with hysterectomy. That being said, there is a sister condition to endometriosis called adenomyosis and that occurs concurrently in 80 to 90% of patients, and so with adenomyosis, the uterus itself can be a source of problems, including pain. In those scenarios, sometimes we do consider a hysterectomy at the time that we're treating endometriosis. What happens if my endometriosis is left untreated? The key thing to remember here is that endometriosis is a progressive condition, and it will continue to grow and may cause progressive symptoms. So for some patients, that means that initially the pain was only with the menstrual cycle. But over time with that progression of disease, the pain can start to occur outside of the cycle, so throughout different times of the month, with urination, with bowel movements, with intercourse. So that can prompt us to need to intervene and do treatment if we hadn't done anything previously. But that being said, even though we know endometriosis is progressive, for some patients, it doesn't ever progress to the point that we would need to do any treatment because it's more of a quality of life issue. And if it's not impacting the quality of life, we don't really need to do anything. Can I become pregnant if I have endometriosis? 100%. You can absolutely have children if you have endometriosis. When we talk about infertility, those are patients who are struggling with pregnancy already. But if we look at all patients with endometriosis, everyone with that diagnosis, the vast majority are able to achieve pregnancy without any problem whatsoever. They can get pregnant, they can carry the pregnancy. They walk home from the hospital with a beautiful baby in their arms. So, yes, unfortunately, infertility can be associat",

Your health care provider will consider both your symptoms and test results to diagnose eosinophilic esophagitis. This will include determining whether you have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).Tests to diagnose eosinophilic esophagitis include: Upper endoscopy. Your provider will use a long, narrow tube (endoscope) containing a light and tiny camera and insert it through your mouth down the esophagus. The lining of your esophagus will be inspected for inflammation and swelling, horizontal rings, vertical furrows, narrowing (strictures), and white spots. Some people with eosinophilic esophagitis will have an esophagus that looks typical. Biopsy. During an endoscopy, a biopsy of your esophagus will be done. A biopsy involves taking a small bit of tissue. Multiple tissue samples will likely be taken from your esophagus and then examined under a microscope for eosinophils. Blood tests. If eosinophilic esophagitis is suspected, you may undergo some additional tests to confirm the diagnosis. These tests look for the sources of your allergic reaction, also called allergens. You may be given blood tests to look for higher than usual eosinophil counts or total immunoglobulin E levels, suggesting an allergy. Esophageal sponge. This test is performed in the health care provider's office. It involves swallowing a capsule attached to a string. The capsule will dissolve in your stomach and release a sponge that the provider will pull out of your mouth with the string. As the sponge is pulled out, it will sample the esophageal tissues. This allows your provider to determine the degree of inflammation in your esophagus without an endoscopy.

Because ependymoma can happen in the brain and the spinal cord, imaging tests may be used to create pictures of both areas. Cerebrospinal fluid testing. Called a lumbar puncture or spinal tap, this procedure involves inserting a needle between two bones in the lower spine. The needle draws out fluid from around the spinal cord. The fluid is tested to look for tumor cells. Based on the test results, your healthcare professional may suspect ependymoma and recommend surgery to remove the tumor. Once removed, the tumor cells are tested in a lab to confirm the diagnosis. Special tests can tell the healthcare team about the types of cells involved in the tumor.

Show transcript for video Epilepsy FAQs Ask Mayo Clinic - Epilepsy Lily Wong-Kisiel, M.D., Pediatric Neurologist, Mayo Clinic: What are the tests for epilepsy? Epilepsy is a syndrome diagnosis. It's a symptom that describes brainwave abnormalities. There are underlying causes that need to be evaluated. MRI of the brain to look for structural abnormality, EEG to look at characteristics of the brainwave activity so the physician can categorize which type or types of seizure the patient has. Then there are, in some children, genetic causes, neurometabolic causes or auto-immune causes that can be looked at. What is a seizure action plan? A seizure action plan is a roadmap for nurses and teachers at school to help your child should a seizure happen at school. It includes information about what type of seizure, what your child's seizure looks like, and if there is any anti-seizure medication that should be used while the seizure is happening to shorten the seizures or how to contact the family should prolonged seizures happen. How harmful are seizures? So most seizures are brief. Depending on the patient, there are absence seizures that are five to six seconds. Other patients may have generalized tonic-clonic seizures which last two to three minutes. Those short, brief seizures, although it may feel like a lifetime for parents, they do not cause negative impact on growth and development. However, we do have to worry about prolonged seizures that are greater than five minutes or multiple seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, more than three in an hour, in which case, your doctor may talk to you about a seizure action plan. How are seizures monitored? This depends on the seizure type. For the absence seizures which are subtle staring, this depends on your observation of how often this is happening to your child. For those patients where it's not possible or practical to monitor all the time, it is helpful to ask and talk to your physician about EEG monitoring with video ongoing. This could be helpful for those subtle seizures that are less detectable by visual inspection. For those patients who have nocturnal seizures where it's not practical to monitor consistently when everyone is asleep, video EEG monitoring can also be quite helpful in determining the seizure frequency. For those patients who have generalized tonic-clonic seizures where there are convulsive movements, there are FDA-cleared devices, wearable devices, that can detect these generalized tonic-clonic seizures based on movements. What is medically refractory epilepsy? Seizures that can't be controlled by medication. About a third of the patients with epilepsy can continue to have seizures despite appropriate treatment. In those patients, evaluation for surgery can be an option. Epilepsy surgery can be an option for those patients who have a focal epilepsy, where a focus can be identified and safely removed. Epilepsy surgery is also an option for certain types of generalized epilepsy, where disconnection surgery can be performed. How can I be the best partner to my epilepsy team? First of all, be prepared with your questions when you come to your clinic visits. Come with your observation of the different seizure type or types that you've observed, know what the duration of the seizures are and have a seizure calendar so that you and your physician and your care team can review the frequency of your seizures.

    "diagnosis": "Erectile dysfunction FAQs Urologist Tobias Kohler, M.D., answers the most frequently asked questions about erectile dysfunction. Show transcript for video Erectile dysfunction FAQs Hi. I'm Dr. Kohler, a urologist at Mayo Clinic. I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about erectile dysfunction. Problems with erectile dysfunction are super common. If you look at the decade of life, that predicts what percent of men will have problems. So, for example, 50% of 50-year-olds, 60% of 60-year-olds, so on and so forth, will have problems with erections. But that does not necessarily mean that as you get older, you have to have problems of the penis. There are plenty of men in their 60s, 70s and 80s and 90s with great sex lives. In other words, if you take great care your penis, your penis will take great care of you. So the things that you can do to take care of yourself to help with erections include exercising, eating well, including a diet high in fruits and vegetables, having a slimmer waistline, sleeping well, quitting smoking. A lot of these things I mentioned are as powerful as medications in helping with erections and improving your sex life. The penis and overall health is so strongly connected, it's really important to remember that the penis is one of the most powerful predictors we have, especially in young men, for heart attacks. The blood vessels that feed the penis are relatively small. Blood vessels in the heart and the neck are a little bit bigger. So therefore, the penis can predict heart attacks or strokes years in advance when they may occur. Yes and no. So when we talk about what truly is a problem with erectile dysfunction, the definition is a problem that lasts greater than three months and is a consistent inability to obtain or maintain an erection adequate for intercourse. So when young men get problems with erections, which is very, very common because it's normal to have bad nights here and there. And so, if it happens occasionally, you don't need to be as worried about that. But if you have consistent problems, you absolutely should and must get checked out by a doctor to figure out what's going on, not only because there are great treatments available, but because we may discover underlying medical problems. When young men have problems with erections, most of the time it's a confidence issue. And so, there are different ways to deal with that. One way is to give medications to get the confidence back. Another way is to use specialists trained in behavioral techniques to get confidence back, so sexual counselors or therapists can really help with this problem. Modern day, we have several new, exciting, experimental things, such as shockwave therapy of the penis or platelet-rich plasma or stem cell therapy. These are not ready for prime time, and so you should not, as a patient, have to spend your hard-earned money to see whether or not this works for you. It's better to be part of a clinical trial to see if that works or to go with more traditional therapies at this point. If you want to be a great partner for your medical team to help solve problems with erections, the number one thing you can do is book an appointment. Just like anything else in life, you have to take the initiative, set up an appointment for your physician, say, \"Doc, I have a problem with sex.\" Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish you well. Diagnosing erectile dysfunction involves having a physical exam and answering questions about your medical and sexual history. If you have ongoing health conditions that could be involved, you might need other tests. Or you might need to see a specialist.Tests for underlying conditions might include: Physical exam. This might involve an exam of your penis and testicles and checking for nerve damage.",

If someone is diagnosed with cirrhosis, a healthcare professional will then typically screen for esophageal varices. How often screening tests are done depends on someone's condition. The main tests used to diagnose esophageal varices are: Upper endoscopy. An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube to visually examine the upper digestive system. This procedure is the preferred method of screening for esophageal varices. The tiny camera lets a medical professional examine the esophagus, stomach and the beginning of the small intestine, called the duodenum. The professional doing the endoscopy looks for dilated veins. If found, the enlarged veins are measured and checked for red streaks and red spots, which usually indicate a significant risk of bleeding. Treatment can be performed during the exam. Imaging tests. Both abdominal CT scans and Doppler ultrasounds of the splenic and portal veins can suggest the presence of esophageal varices. An ultrasound test called transient elastography may be used to measure scarring in the liver. This can help determine if someone has portal hypertension, which may lead to esophageal varices.

Ultrasound — a procedure that uses sound waves to create images of your breast on a monitor — might be used to help place the needle. Tests to evaluate your condition may include: Clinical breast exam. Your doctor feels (palpates) your breasts and the lymph nodes located in your lower neck and underarm area checking for unusual breast tissue. If the breast exam — along with your medical history — suggests you have normal breast changes, you may not need additional tests. But if your doctor finds a new lump or suspicious breast tissue, you may need to come back a few weeks later, after your period, for another clinical breast exam. If the changes persist or the breast exam is concerning, you may need additional tests, such as a diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound. Mammogram. If your doctor detects a breast lump or prominent thickening in your breast tissue, you need a diagnostic mammogram — an X-ray exam that focuses on a specific area of concern in your breast. The radiologist closely examines the area of concern when interpreting the mammogram. Ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to produce images of your breasts and is often performed along with a mammogram. If you're younger than age 30, you might have an ultrasound instead of a mammogram. Ultrasound is better for evaluating a younger woman's dense breast tissue — tissue tightly packed with lobules, ducts and connective tissue (stroma). Ultrasound can also help your doctor distinguish between fluid-filled cysts and solid masses. Fine-needle aspiration. For a breast lump that feels a lot like a cyst, your doctor may try fine-needle aspiration to see if fluid can be withdrawn from the lump. This helpful procedure can be done in the office. A fine-needle aspiration may collapse the cyst and resolve discomfort. Breast biopsy. If a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound are normal, but your doctor still has concerns about a breast lump, you may be referred to a breast surgeon to determine whether you need a surgical breast biopsy. A breast biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of breast tissue for microscopic analysis. If a suspicious area is detected during an imaging exam, your radiologist may recommend an ultrasound-guided breast biopsy or a sterotactic biopsy, which uses mammography to pinpoint the exact location for the biopsy. It's important to report any new or persistent breast changes to your doctor, even if you've had a normal mammogram within the last year. You may need a diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound to evaluate the changes.

Give your care team a detailed history of your or your child's symptoms — which foods, and how much, seem to cause problems. Your family history of allergies. Also share information about members of your family who have allergies of any kind. A physical examination. A careful exam can often identify or exclude other medical problems. A skin test. A skin prick test can determine whether you may react to a particular food. In this test, a small amount of the suspected food is placed on the skin of your forearm or back. A doctor or another healthcare professional then pricks your skin to allow a tiny amount of the substance beneath your skin surface. If you're allergic to a particular substance being tested, you develop a raised bump or reaction. However, a positive reaction to this test alone isn't enough to confirm a food allergy. A blood test. A blood test can measure your immune system's response to particular foods by measuring the allergy-related antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE). For this test, a blood sample taken in your care professional's office is sent to a medical laboratory. It will then be tested for foods that could have caused an allergic reaction. Elimination diet. You may be asked to eliminate suspect foods for a week or two and then add the food items back into your diet one at a time. This process can help link symptoms to specific foods. However, elimination diets aren't foolproof. An elimination diet can't tell you whether your reaction to a food is a true allergy instead of a food sensitivity. Also, if you've had a severe reaction to a food in the past, an elimination diet may not be safe. Oral food challenge. During this test, done in a healthcare professional's office, you'll be given small but increasing amounts of the food suspected of causing your symptoms. If you don't have a reaction during this test, you may be able to include this food in your diet again. More InformationAllergy skin tests",

It also is possible that some symptoms of frontal lobe seizures are the result of seizures that begin in other parts of the brain.To make a diagnosis, a health care professional reviews your symptoms and medical history. The care professional also conducts a physical exam. You may have blood drawn to test for health conditions or disorders that may be causing the seizures.You might need a neurological exam, which will test your: Muscle strength. Sensory skills. Hearing and speech. Vision. Coordination and balance. You also might need the following tests: Brain scans. Brain imaging — usually an MRI — might reveal the source of frontal lobe seizures. An MRI uses radio waves and a powerful magnetic field to produce detailed images of soft tissues, which make up the brain. An MRI involves lying on a narrow table that slides into a long tube. The test often takes about an hour. Some people have a fear of enclosed spaces. They can be given a medicine to feel sleepy and less anxious. The test itself is painless. Electroencephalogram, known as an EEG. An EEG monitors the electrical activity in the brain. This is done by attaching small metal discs called electrodes to the scalp. EEGs often help diagnose some types of epilepsy. However, EEG results might not identify frontal lobe epilepsy. Video EEG. Video EEG is recommended for some people with seizures. This test is usually performed during an overnight stay at a sleep clinic. Both a video camera and an EEG monitor run all night. A video EEG allows health care professionals to match what physically occurs during a seizure with what appears on the EEG.

Sanj Kakar, M.D., Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic: Literally think of it as freezing of the tissues. Ian Roth: Dr. Sanj Kakar, a Mayo Clinic Orthopedic hand and wrist surgeon, says frostbite is more common than many people think. Dr. Kakar: We tend to see frostbite, for example, when the temperature is 5 degrees Fahrenheit with minimal windchill. Ian Roth: If the windchill drops below negative 15 degrees Fahrenheit, not unheard of in the northern half of the U.S., frostbite can set in within half an hour. The most vulnerable areas of frostbite are your nose, ears, fingers and toes. Dr. Kakar: Initially [with] the milder forms, you can get some pain and some numbness of the tips, but the skin can change its color. It can be red. It can be white. Or it can be blue. And you can get these blisters on your hands. And it can be a very serious injury. Ian Roth: The worst cases, the tissue can die, and you may need surgery to remove it. So who's most at risk? Dr. Kakar: [Those most at risk are] certain patients with diabetes, patients who have previous history of frostbite are prone to it, the elderly or your very young children, and also, for example, if you're dehydrated.

Your healthcare professional may recommend tests such as a stool test or breath test to determine whether you have H. pylori. Which type of test you have depends on your situation. For the breath test, you drink a small glass of clear, tasteless liquid that contains radioactive carbon. H. pylori germs break down the test liquid in your stomach. Later, you blow into a bag, which is then sealed. If you're infected with H. pylori, your breath sample will contain the radioactive carbon. Passing a thin, flexible scope down the throat, called an endoscopy. Endoscopy is a procedure to examine the digestive system with a long, thin tube with a tiny camera, called an endoscope. The endoscope passes down the throat, into the esophagus, stomach and small intestine. Using the endoscope, your healthcare professional looks for signs of inflammation. Depending on your age and medical history, your healthcare professional may recommend this as a first test instead of testing for H. pylori. If a suspicious area is found, your healthcare professional may remove small tissue samples, called a biopsy, to test in a lab. A biopsy also can identify the presence of H. pylori in your stomach lining. X-ray of your upper digestive system. X-rays can create images of your esophagus, stomach and small intestine to look for anything unusual. You may have to swallow a white, metallic liquid that contains barium.

A healthcare professional might be able to diagnose GERD based on a history of symptoms and a physical examination.To confirm a diagnosis of GERD, or to check for complications, a care professional might recommend: Upper endoscopy. An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube to visually examine the upper digestive system. The camera helps provide a view of the inside of the esophagus and stomach. Test results may not show when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may find inflammation of the esophagus or other complications. An endoscopy also can be used to collect a sample of tissue, called a biopsy, to be tested for complications such as Barrett esophagus. In some instances, if a narrowing is seen in the esophagus, it can be stretched or dilated during this procedure. This is done to improve trouble swallowing. Ambulatory acid (pH) probe test. A monitor is placed in the esophagus to identify when, and for how long, stomach acid regurgitates there. The monitor connects to a small computer that's worn around the waist or with a strap over the shoulder. The monitor might be a thin, flexible tube, called a catheter, that's threaded through the nose into the esophagus. Or it might be a clip that's placed in the esophagus during an endoscopy. The clip passes into the stool after about two days. X-ray of the upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after drinking a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of the digestive tract. The coating allows a healthcare professional to see a silhouette of the esophagus and stomach. This is particularly useful for people who are having trouble swallowing. Sometimes, an X-ray is done after swallowing a barium pill. This can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that's interfering with swallowing. Esophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in the esophagus while swallowing. Esophageal manometry also measures the coordination and force exerted by the muscles of the esophagus. This is typically done in people who have trouble swallowing. Transnasal esophagoscopy. This test is done to look for any damage in the esophagus. A thin, flexible tube with a video camera is put through the nose and moved down the throat into the esophagus. The camera sends pictures to a video screen.

A tiny camera on the end of the endoscope lets a medical specialist to examine the esophagus, stomach and the beginning of the small intestine, called the duodenum. To find the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, a health care professional will first take your medical history, including a history of previous bleeding, and do a physical exam. Tests also may be ordered, such as: Blood tests. You may need a complete blood count, a test to see how fast your blood clots, a platelet count and liver function tests. Stool tests. Analyzing your stool can help determine the cause of occult bleeding. Nasogastric lavage. A tube is passed through your nose into the stomach to remove stomach contents. This might help find the source of the bleeding. Upper endoscopy. An upper endoscopy is a procedure that uses a camera to view the upper digestive system. The camera is attached to a long, thin tube, called an endoscope, and passed down the throat to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract. Colonoscopy. During a colonoscopy, a long, flexible tube is inserted into the rectum. A tiny video camera at the tip of the tube allows the doctor to view the inside of the entire large intestine and rectum. Capsule endoscopy. In this procedure, you swallow a vitamin-size capsule with a tiny camera inside. The capsule travels through your digestive tract taking thousands of pictures that are sent to a recorder you wear on a belt around your waist. Flexible sigmoidoscopy. A tube with a light and camera is placed in the rectum to look at the rectum and the last part of the large intestine, known as the sigmoid colon. Balloon-assisted enteroscopy. A specialized scope inspects parts of the small intestine that other tests using an endoscope can't reach. Sometimes, the source of bleeding can be controlled or treated during this test. Angiography. A contrast dye is injected into an artery, and a series of X-rays are taken to look for and treat bleeding vessels or other issues. Imaging tests. A variety of other imaging tests, such as a CT scan of the belly, might be used to find the source of the bleed. If your GI bleeding is severe, and noninvasive tests can't find the source, you might need surgery so that doctors can view the entire small intestine. Fortunately, this is rare.

These tests may include: Imaging tests. Imaging tests help your healthcare team find your tumor and see its size. Tests might include ultrasound, CT, MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Not everyone needs every test. Upper endoscopy. This test uses a long, thin tube (endoscope) with a light on the end. The tube goes through the mouth and down the throat. This test looks at the inside of the esophagus, stomach and the first part of the small intestine. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). This test also uses an endoscope, but with an ultrasound probe on the tip of the scope. The ultrasound probe uses sound waves to make pictures of the tumor and show its size. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy. This test collects a small sample of tissue from the tumor so it can be tested in a lab. This test is like EUS, but with a thin, hollow needle on the tip of the endoscope. The EUS finds the tumor. The needle collects small amounts of tissue for the lab tests. Sometimes the needle can't get enough cells, or the results aren't clear. You might need surgery to collect the sample. Laboratory tests on biopsies. The biopsy sample from your tumor goes to a lab for testing. In the lab, specialists test the cells to see if they're cancer cells.

Blood tests show the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormones in the body. TSH is the pituitary hormone that spurs the thyroid gland. People with Graves' disease most often have lower than usual levels of TSH and higher levels of thyroid hormones. Another lab test measures the levels of the antibody known to cause Graves' disease. If the results don't show antibodies, there might be another cause of hyperthyroidism. Radioactive iodine uptake. The body needs iodine to make thyroid hormones. This test involves taking a small amount of radioactive iodine. Later, a special scanning camera shows how much of the iodine gets into the thyroid gland. This test can show how fast the thyroid gland takes up iodine. The amount of radioactive iodine the thyroid gland takes up helps show whether Graves' disease or another condition is the cause of the hyperthyroidism. This test may be used with a radioactive iodine scan to show a picture of the uptake pattern.

I'm Dr. Mohamad Bydon, a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic. I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about back and neck pain. Sleep and stress can both contribute to pain. Sleep is the period during which the body rejuvenates itself. An adequate period of sleep, with good quality of sleep, is very important to manage pain successfully. Stress can also be an exacerbator of pain. Managing stress properly and dealing with it in adequate ways is also a very important component of managing pain. I commonly get questions about mattresses and pillows. And there's good reason for this. We spend so much time sleeping, that sleep is an important component of our back and neck health. With a mattress, the general idea is to have something of medium firmness. You want something that gives just enough support, but not too much support. A mattress that is too soft will put you back into awkward positions at night and exacerbate painful conditions. A mattress that's too firm will not allow your back and neck to rest and will put pressure on areas of your back and neck. In terms of a pillow, you want one that allows neutral position of your neck. So you don't want your neck overly flexed, you don't want it overly extended. So as long as that pillows maintaining neutral position, then that's a good pillow for you for the way that you sleep. Arthritis of the neck and back is a common condition. This is known as wear and tear or degenerative disease. They cause back and neck pain. Back pain is the number one reason to see your doctor, neck pain is the number three reason to see your doctor. In our lifetimes, 80% of us will experience back pain so severe that it requires medical attention. Arthritis cannot be stopped, there is no cure for arthritis, but it can be managed and treated. Core strengthening is very important. Maintaining a good body weight is very important. Building strength, exercise not being sedentary, all of those are things that are very important in helping manage and treating arthritis. It's important to partner with your medical team to get the best result for your health care condition. The best way to do that is to be informed about your condition. We've provided you with a lot of information today that will allow you to work with your doctor and their medical team. Never hesitate to ask your medical team questions that you may have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thank you for your time and we wish you well. During the physical exam, your health care professional will check your back for tenderness. You might be asked to lie flat and move your legs into various positions to help determine the cause of your pain.Your doctor also may perform a neurological exam to check your: Reflexes. Muscle strength. Walking ability. Ability to feel light touches, pinpricks or vibration. In most cases of herniated disk, a physical exam and a medical history are all that are needed for a diagnosis. If your health care professional suspects another condition or needs to see which nerves are affected, you may have one or more of the following tests.",

    "disease": "Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)",
    "diagnosis": "Hyperthyroidism is diagnosed with a medical history, physical exam and blood tests. Depending on the results of the blood tests, you may need other tests too. Medical history and physical exam. During the exam, your health care provider may check for: Slight tremor in your fingers and hands. Overactive reflexes. Rapid or irregular pulse. Eye changes. Warm, moist skin. Your provider also examines your thyroid gland as you swallow to see if it's larger than usual, bumpy or tender. Blood tests. Blood tests that measure the hormones T-4 and T-3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) can confirm a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. A high level of T-4 and a low level of TSH is common in people with hyperthyroidism. Blood tests are particularly important for older adults because they may not have classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid blood tests may give false results if you take biotin. Biotin is a B vitamin supplement that also may be found in multivitamins. Tell your health care provider if you are taking biotin or a multivitamin with biotin. To make sure your blood test is accurate, your health care provider may ask you to stop taking biotin 3 to 5 days before the test. If blood test results show hyperthyroidism, your health care provider may suggest one of the following tests. They can help find out why your thyroid is overactive. Radioiodine scan and uptake test. For this test, you take a small, dose of radioactive iodine, called radioiodine, to see how much of it collects in your thyroid gland and where it collects in the gland. If your thyroid gland takes in a high amount of radioiodine, that means your thyroid gland is making too much thyroid hormone. The most likely cause is either Graves' disease or overactive thyroid nodules. If your thyroid gland takes in a low amount of radioiodine, that means hormones stored in the thyroid gland are leaking into the bloodstream. In that case, it's likely that you have thyroiditis. Thyroid ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of the thyroid. Ultrasound may be better at finding thyroid nodules than are other tests. There's no exposure to radiation with this test, so it can be used for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or others who can't take radioiodine.",

If it's high, the test is done again, along with a blood test for the thyroid hormone T-4. If the results show that TSH is high and T-4 is low, then the diagnosis is hypothyroidism. In some cases, the thyroid hormone T-3 may be measured as well.If the second test shows high TSH but T-4 and T-3 are in the standard range, then the diagnosis is a condition called subclinical hypothyroidism.

An incompetent cervix can be found only during pregnancy. It can be a difficult diagnosis to make, especially during a first pregnancy.Your doctor or other member of your care team may ask about your symptoms and medical history. Be sure to tell your care team if you've had a pregnancy loss in the second trimester of a past pregnancy or if you have a history of preterm delivery. Also tell your care team about any procedures you've had on your cervix.Your doctor might diagnose an incompetent cervix if you have: A history of painless widening of the cervix, known as dilation, and second trimester delivery during a past pregnancy. Advanced cervical dilation and effacement before week 24 of pregnancy. Effacement means the cervix gets thinner and softer. Cervical dilation and effacement can happen without painful contractions. They may also happen with vaginal bleeding, infection or ruptured membranes, which is when your water breaks. Diagnosis of an incompetent cervix during the second trimester also may include: An ultrasound exam. During this exam, you have a thin, wandlike device, called a transducer, placed inside the vagina. This is known as a transvaginal ultrasound. The transducer puts out sound waves that get converted to pictures you can see on a screen. This type of ultrasound can be used to check the length of your cervix and to see if any tissues are sticking out of the cervix. A pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, your doctor checks the cervix to see if the amniotic sac can be felt through the opening. The amniotic sac is where the baby is growing. If the wall of the sac is in the cervical canal or vagina, it's called prolapsed fetal membranes, and it means that the cervix has started to open. Your doctor may also check to see if you're having any contractions and track them, if needed. Lab tests. If you have prolapsed fetal membranes, you may need other tests to rule out an infection. In some cases, this may include taking a sample of amniotic fluid. This is called an amniocentesis. Amniocentesis can be used to check for infection in the amniotic sac and fluid. There are no reliable tests that can be done before pregnancy to predict if you'll have an incompetent cervix.

Every practitioner will tell you that in an ideal world, it shouldn't affect your life at all. It's been well studied that actually inflammatory bowel disease does not significantly change the overall lifespan of the patients. But what we really care about is quality of life. I think for the vast majority of patients that we see, the appropriate medical plan can keep patients generally free of symptoms over the order of one to three years. So I think the biggest ways that the disease is going to affect your life is perhaps you may need to watch a bit what you eat. You'll need to keep in touch with your treatment team and you'll need to take medications as they've been prescribed. But if you do those three things, I think that most practitioners would tell you, we'd rather you not be thinking about your inflammatory bowel disease. Let us worry about that. Why do people get IBD? Most of us that are involved in the research of this condition would suggest that there's three major causes that we study for this condition. The first would be the environment. Most of us believe that there's some environmental insult that leads to the chronic inflammation in the intestine. That environmental insult may be dietary. It may be a particular bug that lives in the bowel, or may be a function of that bug, which is also a function of the diet. The second most important thing is having the right genes. The genetics of inflammatory bowel disease is complicated and actually quite widespread. So most people have the right genetic makeup for this disease but don't actually develop the disease. And then the third component is these two things impact on the immune system. And the immune system is what is actually causing the chronic inflammation that's present in the intestine that we prescribe medications to treat. Can IBD affect my lifespan? The short answer is no, it will not. There's multiple lines of research that when patients with inflammatory bowel disease are controlled against patients their same age, with their same medical problems, without inflammatory bowel disease, achieve roughly the same lifespan. Does my diet affect IBD? If one has a narrowing in the small bowel related to Crohn's disease, something called a stricture, diet becomes very important because if certain patients eat foods that have too much roughage or fiber, then those types of foods can cause an impaction or block the narrowing in the small bowel, leading to signs and symptoms of something we call an obstruction: Belly pain, vomiting, loud noises in the bowel. Another way diet can impact the disease is if you have damage of the small bowel, that can impact your ability to do certain types of functions in the small bowel -- like absorbing dairy products, for example. Is there any cancer risk from having IBD? The main risk factor for cancer would be colorectal or cancer of the large bowel. And that comes, we believe, from the chronic inflammation of the colon. That's why it's a good idea to maintain close contact with your treatment team. And that's why we recommend routine colonoscopies, passing the scope up into the colon, looking for those early changes associated with cancer. What's the risk of passing IBD to my children? That's a very common and valid concern amongst parents that come for evaluation for their inflammatory bowel disease. Generally the risk is slightly higher for Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. But that being said, you're still far more likely to be the only memb",

Your healthcare professional examines your breast to look for changes in skin color, swelling and other signs of inflammatory breast cancer. Imaging tests. Imaging tests make pictures of the body. Your healthcare professional may recommend a breast X-ray, called a mammogram, or a breast ultrasound to look for signs of cancer in your breast. Additional imaging tests, such as an MRI, may be recommended in certain situations. Removing a sample of tissue for testing. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue for testing in a lab. The tissue might be removed using a needle that is put through the skin and into the suspected cancer cells. A skin biopsy also may be helpful. This type of biopsy removes a sample of skin cells.

To diagnose the flu, also called influenza, your healthcare professional does a physical exam, looks for symptoms of flu and possibly orders a test that detects flu viruses.The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. During times when flu is widespread, you may not need a flu test.But a test for flu may be suggested to help guide your care or to know if you could spread the virus to others. A flu test may be done by a pharmacy, your healthcare professional's office or in the hospital. For people age 2 and older, a test you can take at home may be available. If you do use an at-home test, let your healthcare professional know the results. You may need to confirm the results, positive or negative, with a test from your healthcare team.Types of flu tests you may have include: Molecular tests. These tests look for genetic material from the flu virus. Polymerase chain reaction tests, shortened to PCR tests, are molecular tests. You also may hear this type of test called an NAAT test, short for nucleic acid amplification test. Antigen tests. These tests look for viral proteins called antigens. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are one example of antigen tests. It's possible to have a test to diagnose both flu and other respiratory illness, such as COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. You may have both COVID-19 and influenza at the same time. div#vaccine-tool-cta { background: #FFFFFF; border-radius: 8px; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 24px 0; border: 1px solid #D6D6D6; max-width: 100%; } div#vaccine-tool-cta.wide-div { padding: 0 16px 0 0; display: inline-flex; max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0 4px 24px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08); border: none; } div#vaccine-tool-cta div#vaccine-tool-picture-wrapper { display: block; margin: 0; } div#vaccine-tool-cta.wide-div div#vaccine-tool-picture-wrapper { max-width: 279px; width: 318px; height: 100%; aspect-ratio: 0.66; } div#vaccine-tool-cta div#vaccine-tool-picture-wrapper img#vaccine-tool-image { height: 100%; object-fit: cover; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0; } div#vaccine-tool-cta.wide-div div#vaccine-tool-picture-wrapper img#vaccine-tool-image { border-radius: 8px 0 0 8px; } div#vaccine-tool-cta.wide-div div#vaccine-tool-cta-body-wrapper div#vaccine-tool-cta-body-sub-wrapper { top: 50%; -ms-transform: translateY(-50%); transform: translateY(-50%); } div#vaccine-tool-cta h3#vaccine-tool-cta-h3 { font-family: \"mayo-display\", serif; font-size: 32px; line-height: 40px; font-weight: 700; } div#vaccine-tool-cta p#vaccine-tool-cta-p { font-family: \"mayo-sans\", arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; font-weight: 400; } div#vaccine-tool-cta h3#vaccine-tool-cta-h3, div#vaccine-tool-cta p#vaccine-tool-cta-p { color: #080808; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 16px; } div#vaccine-tool-cta h3#vaccine-tool-cta-h3::before { display: none; } div#vaccine-tool-cta div#vaccine-tool-cta-body-wrapper { max-width: 100%; padding: 16px 24px 32px 24px; } div#vaccine-tool-cta div#vaccine-tool-cta-body-wrapper button#vaccine-tool-cta-button { cursor: pointer; color: #0057B8; background-color: #fff; display: block; font-family: \"mayo-sans\", arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 24px; font-weight:",

Imaging tests let your healthcare professional see your internal organs and rule out other causes for your symptoms. Imaging tests may include an X-ray, an ultrasound, a CT scan or an MRI. To look at the blood flow in your veins and arteries, your health professional may use an angiogram using a certain type of CT scan or MRI. Use of a scope to see inside your digestive tract. This involves putting a lighted, flexible tube with a camera on its tip into your rectum to view your digestive tract. The scope can look at the last 2 feet of your colon, a test called sigmoidoscopy. When the test looks at your whole colon, it's called colonoscopy. Use of dye that tracks blood flow through the arteries. During this test, called angiography, a long, thin tube called a catheter goes into an artery in your groin or arm. A dye injected through the catheter flows to your intestinal arteries. The dye moving through the arteries lets narrowed areas or blockages show up on X-rays. Angiography also lets a healthcare professional treat a blockage in an artery. The health professional can remove a clot, put in medicine or use special tools to widen an artery. Surgery. In some cases, you may need surgery to find and remove damaged tissue. Opening the belly allows diagnosis and treatment during one procedure. More InformationColonoscopyCT scanUpper endoscopy",

It may involve looking through a device that contains wheels of different lenses, called a phoropter. This device helps judge which combination offers the sharpest vision. Some eye doctors may use a hand-held instrument called a retinoscope to check the eyes. Slit-lamp examination. This test involves directing a vertical beam of light on the surface of the eye and using a low-powered microscope to view the eye. The eye doctor evaluates the shape of the cornea and looks for other potential problems in the eye. Keratometry. This exam involves focusing a circle of light on the cornea and measures the reflection. This determines the basic shape of the cornea. Computerized corneal mapping. Special photographic tests, such as corneal tomography and corneal topography, record images to create a detailed shape map of the cornea. Corneal tomography also can measure the thickness of the cornea. This type of testing can often detect early signs of keratoconus before the disease is visible by slit-lamp examination.

    "diagnosis": "Kidney cancer FAQs Urologic oncologist Bradley Leibovich, M.D., answers the most frequently asked questions about kidney cancer. Show transcript for video Kidney cancer FAQs I'm Dr. Brad Leibovich, a urologic oncologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some questions patients may have about kidney cancer. Patients diagnosed with kidney cancer often want to know what could they have done differently to prevent this from happening in the first place. In most cases, kidney cancer is completely unrelated to how you've lived your life. And there's really nothing you could have done differently to have prevented this. Prognosis for kidney cancer depends upon the stage at which the kidney cancer is discovered. For patients with early stage disease, the prognosis is excellent and the expectation is typically that somebody will be cured of their kidney cancer. For later stage disease, thankfully, we have many new treatments. And even if it's not possible to cure a patient, the expectation is we will significantly extend their life. Patients that have been diagnosed with kidney cancer often want to know if it's necessary to remove the entire kidney. In some cases, the kidney can be preserved and only the tumor needs to be removed. In other cases, it's necessary to remove the entire kidney. Thankfully, most patients have a second kidney and have good enough kidney function with just one kidney, that this is not a problem. Since most patients have relatively normal kidney function after having a kidney removed, in the majority of circumstances, you do not have to change your lifestyle. Most important is that you have a healthy lifestyle overall. Get good sleep, regular exercise, and have a healthy balanced diet. If you do need to change something about your lifestyle, your doctor will tell you. Many patients want to know if they need to alter their diet after treatment for kidney cancer. In the majority of circumstances, people have normal enough kidney function that no special diet is required, and people can eat and drink however they did previously. In my opinion, being the best partner to your medical team means learning as much as you can about your diagnosis and about your options. This will empower you to make the best decisions that are right for you. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or inform them of any concerns you may have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thank you for your time. We wish you well. Stage 1 kidney cancer Enlarge image Close Stage 1 kidney cancer Stage 1 kidney cancer A stage 1 kidney cancer means that the tumor in the kidney is 2 3/4 inches (7 centimeters) in diameter or smaller. The cancer is only in one kidney and completely contained within it. Stage 2 kidney cancer Enlarge image Close Stage 2 kidney cancer Stage 2 kidney cancer A stage 2 kidney cancer means that the tumor in the kidney is larger than 2 3/4 inches (7 centimeters) in diameter, but it's still confined to the kidney. Stage 3 kidney cancer Enlarge image Close Stage 3 kidney cancer Stage 3 kidney cancer A stage 3 kidney cancer may mean that the tumor in the kidney extends to the surrounding tissue. It also may mean that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage 4 kidney cancer Enlarge image Close Stage 4 kidney cancer Stage 4 kidney cancer A stage 4 kidney cancer may mean that the tumor has grown beyond the kidney. It also may mean that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver or lungs. Kidney cancer diagn",

    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves the steps that your healthcare professional takes to find out if you have kidney stones. Diagnosis also can include testing to find the cause and chemical makeup of kidney stones. Your healthcare professional starts by giving you a physical exam. You also may need tests such as: Blood tests. Blood tests may reveal too much calcium or uric acid in your blood. Blood test results help track the health of your kidneys. These results also may lead your healthcare professional to check for other health conditions. Urine testing. Your healthcare professional may ask you to collect samples of your urine over 24 hours. The 24-hour urine collection test may show that your body is releasing too many stone-forming minerals or too few substances that prevent stones. Follow your healthcare professional's instructions closely. Collecting the urine appropriately is key to make changes in your treatment plan to prevent new stones from forming. Imaging. Imaging tests such as CT scans may show kidney stones in your urinary tract. An advanced scan known as a high-speed or dual energy CT scan may help find tiny uric acid stones. Simple X-rays of the stomach area, also called the abdomen, are used less often. That's because this kind of imaging test can miss small kidney stones. Ultrasound is another imaging option to diagnose kidney stones. Analysis of passed stones. You may be asked to urinate through a strainer to catch any stones that you pass. Then a lab checks the chemical makeup of your kidney stones. Your healthcare professional uses this information to find out what's causing your kidney stones and to form a plan to prevent more kidney stones. Genetic testing. Some rare conditions that pass from parent to child make kidney stones more likely. For instance, having cystinuria raises the risk of cystine stones. Primary hyperoxaluria raises the risk of calcium oxalate stones. If your healthcare professional thinks you might have such a condition, your healthcare professional may recommend genetic testing to find out for sure.

A blood sample is sent to the lab to check the shape and number of chromosomes. Healthcare professionals sometimes diagnose Klinefelter syndrome before birth when testing is done for another reason. The syndrome can be found in pregnancy during a procedure to look at fetal cells taken from the fluid around the baby or from the placenta. These tests may be done for pregnant people who are older than age 35 or have a family history of genetic conditions.Klinefelter syndrome may be suspected during a noninvasive prenatal screening blood test.

You may be asked to bend forward from the waist to allow your healthcare professional to view your spine from the side. You also may undergo a neurological exam to check your reflexes and muscle strength.Tests that may be ordered include: X-rays or CT scans. X-rays can determine the degree of curvature and detect deformities of the vertebrae. A CT scan might be recommended if your healthcare professional needs more detailed imaging. MRI. Using a strong magnetic field, MRIs can detect a recent fracture in your spine. Nerve tests. If you are experiencing numbness or muscle weakness, you may need tests to determine how well nerve impulses are traveling between your spinal cord and your extremities. Bone density tests. Low-density bone can increase the risk for compression fractures and often can be improved with medicines.

I'm Dr. Sean Cleary, a liver surgeon at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about liver cancer. After I am diagnosed, how should I choose a care team? When thinking about choosing a center for liver cancer treatment, you want to think about a center that treats a lot of liver cancer and that has all the members of a team required to treat your disease. This can include hepatologists or liver doctors, liver surgeons and transplant surgeons, and medical and radiation oncologists. How can I be the best partner to my medical team? One of the best ways to partner with your care team is to be engaged. Ask questions. Ask them about the treatment options available. Discuss the pros and cons and benefits of any proposed treatments. And together make a decision on what's best for you. Being informed makes all the difference. How will my diagnosis affect my diet and lifestyle? Once you've been diagnosed with liver cancer, we want to try and avoid things that might further damage the liver. And these can include alcohol and smoking. Otherwise, we want to try and be as healthy as possible by maintaining a healthy diet and regular exercise. Do I need a biopsy? Liver cancer is one of the cancers where we may not need a biopsy to make decisions about your care. Sometimes, liver cancer can be reliably diagnosed on imaging studies such as CT scans or MRIs. It's important to talk to your doctor and your medical team to determine whether a biopsy is necessary as part of your care plan. Is chemotherapy or immunotherapy appropriate for me? We've had a lot of exciting developments in the field of chemotherapy and immunotherapy for liver cancer. It's important to talk to your doctor and your medical team to determine whether chemotherapy or immunotherapy might be right as part of your treatment plan. Thanks for your time.

For some women, low sex drive is part of an ongoing condition called sexual interest-arousal disorder. It involves having at least three of the following symptoms, which cause sadness or anxiety: No desire to have any type of sexual activity or to masturbate. Few or no sexual thoughts or fantasies. Not wanting to make the first move in a sexual encounter with a partner. Less or no pleasure during sexual activity. Less or no interest in any sexual or erotic cues from a partner. Few or no physical sensations during sexual activity in most sexual encounters. You don't have to fit this definition to reach out for help. Your healthcare professional can look for reasons that your sex drive isn't as high as you'd like.During your appointment, your healthcare professional asks you questions about your medical and sexual history. Your health professional also might: Do a pelvic exam. This checks for signs of physical changes that sometimes play a role in low sexual desire. These changes can include certain skin diseases of the vulva, thinning of the vaginal tissues, vaginal dryness or pain-triggering spots. Recommend testing. Blood tests can check hormone levels. They also can look for thyroid problems, diabetes, high cholesterol and liver disorders. Refer you to a specialist.

    "disease": "Lymphoma",
    "diagnosis": "Lymphoma FAQs Hematologist Stephen Ansell, M.D., answers the most frequently asked questions about lymphoma. Show transcript for video Lymphoma FAQs Well, many times we don't actually know. We do know what exactly happens in the cells. We can see that the cells undergo a genetic change. And as they do that, they may grow quicker than they should, and they may persist and not die off like they should. That causes them to slowly accumulate over time. But exactly what brought about that genetic change, we don't always know. This is not a disease that's passed down in families, although families can be more susceptible. But we think there are some susceptibility genes that may put you at risk for being more likely to get lymphoma. That does, however, require something else to happen, often in the way of exposures to toxins or viruses or something else. Well, I think it's important to recognize what the goals of treatment are. Low-grade lymphomas have an advantage in that they can take a very long time to cause any symptoms, and certainly a very long time to put the patient's health at risk. However, we do not have a curative treatment that will fix the cancer right away. So we want to weigh up the potential risks and side effects that come with treatment compared to, clearly, the risks and side effects that come from the cancer. So, if you have a cancer that is very low-grade, growing very slowly, giving you no symptoms, we would hold off on treatment and only initiate it when you truly need it. Well, important to know that chemotherapy may have two components. Chemotherapy, or chemical drugs that are targeting the cancer, immunotherapy, or antibody treatments that are going after proteins that are on the outside of the cancer or lymphoma cells. The goal of chemotherapy is to kill quickly- growing cells, which is a good thing because lymphoma, many times, those cells are growing quickly. The challenge, however, is there are healthy cells that may also be growing quickly. Immunotherapy, as I mentioned, binds or attacks proteins on the outsides of cells. But some of the lymphoma cells and some of the normal cells have the same proteins. So those cells may be depleted, and your immune system may become a little bit more suppressed as one of the potential side effects of therapy. Well, I really wish that was true. Unfortunately, that's not exactly correct. There isn't a treatment or exercise program that directly targets or goes after the lymphoma cells. Generally, however, what a healthy balanced diet and a good exercise program is doing is improving your general well-being, improving your immune system function, and allowing you to tolerate the chemotherapy and fight against the cancer to a greater degree. The good news is that many studies have shown that a healthy patient who's in good shape actually has a better outcome when receiving treatment for lymphoma. So that's a strong motivation for you to be healthy by eating well and exercising regularly. Get as much information as you can. Partner with your physician, your nurse practitioner, your PA and other members of the team and ask questions. The goal moving forward is for you to have the best outcome possible. So that sharing of information between your team and you is critical to your outcome and the best results we could hope for. Bone marrow exam Enlarge image Close Bone marrow exam Bone marrow exam In a bone marrow aspiration, a healthcare professional uses a thin needle to remove a small amount of liquid bone marrow. It is usually taken from a spot in the back of the hip bone, also called the pelvis. A bone marrow biopsy is often done at the same time. This second procedure removes a small piece of bone tissue and the enclosed marrow. Lymphoma diagnosis often begins with an exam that checks for swollen lymph nodes",

    "disease": "Male infertility",
    "diagnosis": "Many infertile couples have more than one cause of infertility, so it's likely you will both need to see a doctor. It might take a number of tests to determine the cause of infertility. In some cases, a cause is never identified.Infertility tests can be expensive and might not be covered by insurance — find out what your medical plan covers ahead of time.Diagnosing male infertility problems usually involves: General physical examination and medical history. This includes examining your genitals and asking questions about any inherited conditions, chronic health problems, illnesses, injuries or surgeries that could affect fertility. Your doctor might also ask about your sexual habits and about your sexual development during puberty. Semen analysis. Semen samples can be obtained in a couple of different ways. You can provide a sample by masturbating and ejaculating into a special container at the doctor's office. Because of religious or cultural beliefs, some men prefer an alternative method of semen collection. In such cases, semen can be collected by using a special condom during intercourse. Your semen is then sent to a laboratory to measure the number of sperm present and look for any abnormalities in the shape (morphology) and movement (motility) of the sperm. The lab will also check your semen for signs of problems such as infections.Often sperm counts fluctuate significantly from one specimen to the next. In most cases, several semen analysis tests are done over a period of time to ensure accurate results. If your sperm analysis is normal, your doctor will likely recommend thorough testing of your female partner before conducting any more male infertility tests.Your doctor might recommend additional tests to help identify the cause of your infertility. These can include: Scrotal ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images inside your body. A scrotal ultrasound can help your doctor see if there is a varicocele or other problems in the testicles and supporting structures. Transrectal ultrasound. A small, lubricated wand is inserted into your rectum. It allows your doctor to check your prostate and look for blockages of the tubes that carry semen. Hormone testing. Hormones produced by the pituitary gland, hypothalamus and testicles play a key role in sexual development and sperm production. Abnormalities in other hormonal or organ systems might also contribute to infertility. A blood test measures the level of testosterone and other hormones. Post-ejaculation urinalysis. Sperm in your urine can indicate your sperm are traveling backward into the bladder instead of out your penis during ejaculation (retrograde ejaculation). Genetic tests. When sperm concentration is extremely low, there could be a genetic cause. A blood test can reveal whether there are subtle changes in the Y chromosome — signs of a genetic abnormality. Genetic testing might be ordered to diagnose various congenital or inherited syndromes. Testicular biopsy. This test involves removing samples from the testicle with a needle. If the results of the testicular biopsy show that sperm production is normal your problem is likely caused by a blockage or another problem with sperm transport. Specialized sperm function tests. A number of tests can be used to check how well your sperm survive after ejaculation, how well they can penetrate an egg, and whether there's any problem attaching to the egg. These tests aren't often used and usually don't significantly change recommendations for treatment.

    "disease": "Migraine",
    "diagnosis": "Migraine FAQs Amaal Starling, M.D., a neurologist at Mayo Clinic, answers the important questions you may have about migraine. Show transcript for video Migraine FAQs Hi, I'm Dr. Amaal Starling, a neurologist at Mayo Clinic. And I'm here to answer some of the important questions that you might have about migraine. Why doesn't migraine show up on MRI? Migraine is a disease of abnormal function within the setting of normal brain structure. An MRI of the brain solely tells you about the structure of the brain but tells you very little about the function of the brain. And that is why migraine doesn't show up on an MRI. Because it's abnormal function in the setting of normal structure. How can this much pain be just migraine? Migraine is highly disabling for some individuals. In fact, it is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. Disabling symptoms are not just the pain, but also the sensitivity to light and sound, as well as the nausea and vomiting. Do I need daily treatment if I don’t have daily attacks? There is a wide range of disease severity in migraine. There are some people who only need a rescue or an acute treatment for migraine because they have infrequent migraine attacks. But there are other people who are having frequent migraine attacks, maybe two or three times a week. If they used rescue treatments for every attack, it could potentially lead to other complications. Those individuals need a preventive treatment regimen to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Those preventive treatments might be daily medications. They might be once a month injections or other injectable medications delivered once every three months. What should I do on the days I can’t take my rescue medication? This is why preventive treatment is so crucial. With preventive treatment, we can reduce the frequency as well as the severity of attacks so that you're not having attacks more than two times per week. However, for some individuals, despite preventive treatment, they may still have migraine symptoms more frequently throughout the week. For them, there are non-medication options for treating pain, such as biofeedback, relaxation techniques, cognitive behavioral therapy, as well as a number of devices that are non-medication options for treating migraine pain. Should I consider neurotoxin injections for migraine? Yes, that is an option for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. These onabotulinum toxin A injections are administered by your doctor once every 12 weeks to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. However, there are many different preventive treatment options. And it is important for you to speak with your doctor about which option is best for you. How can I be the best partner to my medical team? The best way to partner with your medical team is to, number one, get a medical team. Many people living with migraine have not even talked to a doctor about their symptoms. If you have headaches where you have to rest in a dark room, where you might get sick to your stomach. Please talk to your healthcare professional about your symptoms. You might have migraine and we can treat migraine. Migraine is a chronic disease. And to best manage this disease, patients need to understand the disease. This is why I prescribe advocacy to all of my patients. Learn about migraine, join patient advocacy organizations, share your journey with others, and become empowered through advocacy and efforts to shatter the stigma of migraine. And together, the patient and the medical team can manage the disease of migraine. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns that you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish you well. If you have migraines or a family history of migraines, a specialist trained in treating headaches, known as a neurologist, will likely diagnose migraines based on your med",

A diagnosis is made based on the information you provide, your medical evaluation and results of tests.Many healthcare professionals diagnose MCI based on criteria developed by a panel of international experts: Changes in memory or another mental ability. People with MCI may have symptoms related to memory, planning, following instructions or making decisions. A healthcare professional may confirm these issues with a family member or a close friend. Mental ability that declines over time. This is revealed with a careful medical history. The change is confirmed by a family member or a close friend. Daily activities aren't affected. Symptoms may cause worry, but people with MCI are still able to live their lives as usual. Mental status testing shows mild changes for age and education level. These include brief tests such as the Short Test of Mental Status, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). More detailed testing may show to what degree memory has changed. The tests also may reveal the types of memory most affected and whether other mental skills are affected. The diagnosis isn't dementia. Symptoms aren't serious enough to be diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease dementia or another type of dementia.",

    "disease": "Miscarriage",
    "diagnosis": "Your health care team might do a variety of tests: Blood tests. These can check the level of the pregnancy hormone, called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in your blood. This level is often repeated after 48 hours. A low or falling level of hCG could be a sign of pregnancy loss. If the pattern of changes in your hCG level is irregular, your health care professional may recommend more blood tests or an ultrasound. Your blood type also might be checked. If your blood type is Rh negative, a medicine called Rh immunoglobulin (RhoGAM) will likely be recommended unless you are less than six weeks pregnant. Pelvic exam. Your health care professional might check to see if the lower end of your uterus, called the cervix, has begun to open. If it has, that makes a miscarriage more likely. Ultrasound. During this imagining test, your health care professional checks for a fetal heartbeat and figures out if the pregnancy is growing properly. If the result of the test isn't clear, you might need to have another ultrasound in about a week. Tissue tests. If you've passed what looks like tissue, it can be sent to a lab to confirm that a miscarriage has happened — and that your symptoms aren't tied to another cause. Chromosomal tests. If you've had two or more previous miscarriages, your health care professional may recommend blood tests for both you and your partner. The tests can help find out if your or your partner's chromosome make-up might be linked with increased risk for miscarriage. If your test results show that you had a miscarriage or are at risk of having one, your health care professional might use one of the following medical terms to describe what happened: Threatened miscarriage. This means that you have bleeding from the vagina, but your cervix hasn't begun to open. So there is a threat of a miscarriage. Such pregnancies typically go on without any more problems. Inevitable miscarriage. This describes a miscarriage that can't be avoided because you're bleeding, cramping and your cervix is open. Incomplete miscarriage. This is when you pass pregnancy tissue but some remains in your uterus. Missed miscarriage. The placental and embryonic tissues remain in the uterus, but the embryo has died or was never formed. Complete miscarriage. This means you have passed all the pregnancy tissues. This is common for miscarriages that happen before 12 weeks. Septic miscarriage. This condition happens when you get an infection in your uterus after a miscarriage. This can be a life-threatening infection. You need medical care right away.

    "disease": "Mitral valve disease",
    "diagnosis": "To diagnose mitral valve disease, including mitral valve stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation, a health care professional examines you and asks questions about your medical history.The health care professional listens to your heart with a device called a stethoscope. A whooshing sound, called a heart murmur, may be a sign of a mitral valve condition.Tests to diagnose mitral valve disease may include: Echocardiogram. Sound waves are used to create pictures of the heart in motion. This test shows how blood moves through the heart and heart valves, including the mitral valve. An echocardiogram can help in the diagnosis of congenital mitral valve disease, rheumatic mitral valve disease and other heart valve conditions. A standard echocardiogram is done from outside the body. But sometimes, a more-detailed echocardiogram is needed to get a closer look at the mitral valve. This type of echocardiogram is called a transesophageal echocardiogram. It is done from inside the body. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and simple test measures the heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast or how slowly the heart is beating. Sticky patches called sensors or electrodes are attached to the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the patches to a computer, which prints or displays results. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray is a picture of the heart and lungs. It can show whether the heart is enlarged, which can be a sign of certain types of heart valve disease. Cardiac MRI. This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the heart. A cardiac MRI might be done to determine the severity of mitral valve disease. Exercise tests or stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart is checked. Exercise tests help reveal how the heart responds to physical activity and whether valve disease symptoms occur during exercise. If you can't exercise, you may get medicine that affects the heart like exercise does. Cardiac catheterization. A doctor guides a thin tube called a catheter through a blood vessel to an artery in the heart. Dye flows through the catheter. This makes the heart arteries show up more clearly on an X-ray. Cardiac catheterization isn't often used to diagnose mitral valve disease, but it may be used if other tests haven't diagnosed the condition. It also may be done to see if you have coronary artery disease.",

    "diagnosis": "Mouth cancer FAQs Oncologist Katharine Price, M.D., answers common questions about mouth cancer, which is also called oral cancer. Show transcript for video Mouth cancer FAQs Hi. I'm Dr. Katharine Price at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about oral cancer. There are several things that you can do to prevent oral cancer. The most important is not to use any tobacco. It is also important not to drink too much alcohol or to abstain from alcohol altogether. A very simple thing that everyone can do that will decrease the risk of oral cancer is increase fruit and vegetable consumption. It's very important to try and reduce stress and to exercise on a regular basis. So as a cancer doctor, I'm commonly asked what is my chance of cure? And that's a very difficult question because there is no absolute time point where we can say that you are cured of your cancer. But for oral cancer, most of the cancers will come back within the first two years of treatment. And if somebody gets to five years after treatment with no sign of cancer, the chance of it coming back is very, very low. So in general, we think about a five-year mark after cancer treatment as being cured. But again, it is not an absolute cut-off and sometimes we'll see recurrences beyond that point. But it is very unlikely. It is very important for all patients to know that mental illness after or during a diagnosis of oral cancer is very common. The most common things that we'll see are depression and anxiety. Depression is very common, particularly when patients are going through treatment or immediately afterwards where they still have a lot of symptoms that they're trying to recover from. Anxiety would be the most common thing that we see. Because a diagnosis of cancer highlights the uncertainty of the future. None of us know what the future holds. None of us know if we're going to survive tomorrow or a year or 10 years from now. But having a cancer diagnosis really brings that to the forefront. What is really important for patients to know is that help is available. That help can take a lot of different forms, from medications to therapy to alternative treatments. If you happen to be taking care of somebody who has oral cancer and is going through oral cancer treatment, the most important thing that you can do is show up and be there for them in a general sense. There's a lot of things that are impacted when somebody goes through oral cancer treatment. Some of the things that we do every day are hard: eating, sleeping, speaking. They may have pain. They may have side effects from treatment. And unfortunately, as a caregiver, you can't take any of those things away, but you can be supportive in a general sense and just be there with them. Know that you can't fix it, but that you can walk on that pathway with them so that they're not alone. When someone is going through cancer treatment, your medical team does not expect you to pretend like everything's okay or put on a happy face. We know that you're going through difficult problems and we know that the treatment that we're having you do can be very difficult and cause a lot of symptoms. So the single most important thing is to communicate with your team, to let them know how you're doing. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish you well. Mouth cancer diagnosis might start with an exam of the lips and mouth. A healthcare professional might remove a sample of tissue for testing to see if you have mouth cancer.",

Several tests are generally needed to diagnose moyamoya disease and any underlying conditions.Tests may include: Magnetic resonance imaging. This imaging test also is known as an MRI. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. A healthcare professional may inject a dye into a blood vessel to view your arteries and veins and highlight blood circulation. This type of test is called a magnetic resonance angiogram. Your neurologist may recommend a perfusion MRI. This type of imaging can measure the amount of blood passing through the vessels. It can show if there is a decrease in blood supply to the brain. Computerized tomography scan. Also known as a CT scan, this imaging test uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of your brain. A healthcare professional may inject a dye into a blood vessel to highlight blood flow in your arteries and veins. This is called a CT angiogram. This test can't diagnose early stages of moyamoya disease. But it may help find problems with blood vessels. Cerebral angiogram. In a cerebral angiogram, a healthcare professional inserts a long, thin tube called a catheter into a blood vessel in your groin. The healthcare professional then uses X-ray imaging to guide the catheter to your brain and injects dye through the catheter into the blood vessels of your brain. The dye conforms to the shape of the blood vessels to make them more visible under X-ray imaging. Positron emission tomography scan or single-photon emission computerized tomography. In these tests, you're injected with a small amount of a safe radioactive material. Positron emission tomography, also called PET, provides visual images of brain activity. Single-photon emission computerized tomography, called SPECT for short, measures blood flow to the brain. Electroencephalogram. An electroencephalogram also is called an EEG. It monitors the electrical activity in your brain using small metal disks, called electrodes, attached to your scalp. Children with moyamoya disease often have EEG results that are out of the typical range. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound. In surgical transcranial Doppler ultrasound, sound waves are used to obtain images of your head and sometimes your neck. Specialists may use this test to evaluate blood flow in blood vessels in your neck. If necessary, your neurologist may order other tests to rule out other conditions.

    "disease": "Multiple sclerosis",
    "diagnosis": "Neurological exam Enlarge image Close Neurological exam Neurological exam A complete neurological exam and medical history are needed to diagnose MS. Multiple sclerosis FAQs Neurologist Oliver Tobin, M.B., B.Ch., B.A.O., Ph.D., answers the most frequently asked questions about multiple sclerosis. Show transcript for video Multiple sclerosis FAQs So people who are overweight have a higher chance of developing MS and people who have MS who are overweight tend to have more active disease and a faster onset of progression. The main diet has been shown to be neuroprotective is the Mediterranean diet. This diet is high in fish, vegetables, and nuts, and low in red meat. So this question comes up a lot because patients who have multiple sclerosis can sometimes get a transient worsening of their symptoms in heat or if they exercise strenuously. The important thing to note is that heat does not cause an MS attack or MS relapse. And so it's not dangerous. You're not doing any permanent damage if this occurs. Exercise is strongly recommended and is protective to the brain and spinal cord. Scientists do not yet know which stem cells are beneficial in MS, what route to give them or what dose to give them or what frequency. So at the moment, stem cell treatments are not recommended outside of the context of a clinical trial. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or NMOSD and MOG-associated disorder can give features similar to multiple sclerosis. These are more common in people of Asian or African-American ethnicity. And your doctor may recommend blood tests to exclude these disorders. Well, the first drug approved by the FDA for treatment of multiple sclerosis was in 1993. Since then, over 20 drugs have become available for treatment of MS. And the potency of these drugs has increased over time to the point where we can almost completely suppress the inflammatory component of the disease. This would not be possible if patients like you did not enroll in research studies. There are many different types of research studies, not just drug trials, but also observational studies, as all of these enhance our understanding of the disease, hopefully to lead to even better cures for multiple sclerosis. Well, the most important thing about having a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is that you are at the center of your medical team. A comprehensive MS center is the best place for management of multiple sclerosis, and this typically includes physicians with expertise in multiple sclerosis, neurologists, but also urologists, physiatrists or physical medicine and rehabilitation providers, psychologists, and many other providers who have specialty interest in multiple sclerosis. Engaging this team around you and your particular needs will improve your outcomes over time. There are no specific tests for MS. The diagnosis is given by a combination of medical history, physical exam, MRIs and spinal tap results. A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis also involves ruling out other conditions that might produce similar symptoms. This is known as a differential diagnosis.

Healthcare professionals confirm that symptoms were caused by a typical attack type, such as optic neuritis, transverse myelitis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). MOGAD also is diagnosed after the MOG-antibody is found in the blood or spinal fluid.These two things can be confirmed by a few procedures, including: MOG antibody testing with a cell-based assay. This test looks at cells with MOG on their surface to see if the MOG-antibody is present in the blood. This test is considered the gold standard for testing for MOGAD, but there is potential for false positives. Caution is needed if the symptoms aren't typical or are similar to those of another disease, such as multiple sclerosis. Spinal tap. Also called a lumbar puncture, this procedure collects a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This sample can show if there is an elevated white blood cell count. This causes inflammation and is common in MOGAD. A spinal tap also can look for a type of protein in the spinal fluid called oligoclonal bands. These bands are more common in multiple sclerosis and may help make a distinction between the two diseases. Imaging tests. You may need an MRI of the brain, spine and optic nerve. These images can show irregular spots on the brain and spinal cord, called lesions, and inflammation of the optic nerve. Eye exam. An eye exam, called an optical coherence tomography, can help diagnose MOGAD. This test shows the layers of the part of the eye called the retina. During episodes of optic neuritis, the retina is often thicker than usual. After these episodes, damage to the nerve cells in the retina causes the retina to get thinner. The MOG antibody test isn't always accurate. Sometimes healthy people or people with other diseases can have MOG antibodies at lower levels.

It may help determine where in the brain the myoclonus originates. First, small electrodes are attached to the scalp. You then may be asked to breathe deeply and steadily and look at bright lights or listen to sounds. These actions may uncover irregular electrical activity. Electromyography (EMG). In this procedure, electrodes are placed on multiple muscles, especially muscles that are involved in the jerking. An instrument records the electrical activity from the muscles when they are at rest and when they are contracted, such as when you bend your arm. These signals help determine the pattern and origin of the myoclonus. Evoked potential studies. These tests measure the electrical activity of the brain, brainstem and spinal cord that is triggered by touch, sound, sight and other stimuli. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI scan may be used to check for structural problems or tumors inside the brain or spinal cord, which may cause the myoclonus symptoms. An MRI scan uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the body. Laboratory tests. Your health care provider may suggest genetic testing to help identify possible causes of myoclonus. Blood or urine tests may be needed to check for metabolic disorders, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and kidney or liver disease. They also can check for drugs or toxins.

Your healthcare professional likely will refer you to a sleep specialist. Formal diagnosis usually requires staying overnight at a sleep center for an in-depth sleep analysis.A sleep specialist will likely diagnose narcolepsy and determine how serious it is based on: Your sleep history. A detailed sleep history can help with a diagnosis. You'll likely fill out the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The scale uses short questions to measure your degree of sleepiness. You'll answer how likely it is that you would fall asleep in certain times, such as sitting down after lunch. Your sleep records. You may be asked to write down your sleep pattern for a week or two. This allows your healthcare professional to compare how your sleep pattern may relate to how alert you feel. You might wear a device on your wrist, known as an actigraph. It measures periods of activity and rest, along with how and when you sleep. A sleep study, known as polysomnography. This test measures signals during sleep using flat metal discs called electrodes placed on your scalp. For this test, you must spend a night at a medical facility. The test measures your brain waves, heart rate and breathing. It also records your leg and eye movements. Multiple sleep latency test. This test measures how long it takes you to fall asleep during the day. You'll be asked to take four or five naps at a sleep center. Each nap needs to be two hours apart. Specialists will observe your sleep patterns. People who have narcolepsy fall asleep easily and enter into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep quickly. Genetic tests and a lumbar puncture, known as a spinal tap. Occasionally, a genetic test may be performed to see if you're at risk of type 1 narcolepsy. If so, your sleep specialist may recommend a lumbar puncture to check the level of hypocretin in your spinal fluid. This test is only done in specialized centers. These tests also can help rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. Extreme daytime sleepiness also could be caused by not getting enough sleep, medicines that make you sleepy and sleep apnea.

With a skin prick test, tiny drops of allergy-causing agents are pricked into the skin of the forearm or upper back. A health care provider then watches the skin for allergic reactions. If a skin test can't be done, a blood test can screen for allergies. Test for cystic fibrosis. A child who has nasal polyps might have cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that make mucus, sweat and the juices that help food digest. It's an inherited condition. A test for cystic fibrosis is a sweat test. A chemical put on the skin causes the area to sweat. The test shows if the sweat is saltier than most people's sweat is. Blood tests.

    "disease": "Neuromyelitis optica",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosing neuromyelitis optica involves a physical exam and tests. Part of the diagnosis process is to rule out other nervous system conditions that have similar symptoms. Healthcare professionals also look for symptoms and test results linked to NMO. Criteria to diagnose neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) were proposed in 2015 by the International Panel for NMO Diagnosis.A healthcare professional reviews your medical history and symptoms and does a physical exam. Other tests include: Neurological exam. A neurologist examines movement, muscle strength, coordination, sensation, memory, thinking, vision and speech. An eye doctor also might be involved in the exam. MRI. This imaging test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create a detailed view of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord. The results may show lesions or damaged areas in the brain, optic nerves or spinal cord. Blood tests. A healthcare professional might test the blood for the autoantibody that binds to proteins and causes NMO. The autoantibody is called aquaporin-4-immunoglobulin G, also known as AQP4-IgG. Testing for this autoantibody can help healthcare professionals distinguish between NMO and MS and make an early diagnosis of NMO. Other biomarkers such as serum glial fibrillary acidic protein, also called GFAP, and serum neurofilament light chain help detect relapses. A myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunoglobulin G antibody test, also called an MOG-IgG antibody test, also might be used to look for another inflammatory disorder that mimics NMO. Lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. During this test, a healthcare professional inserts a needle into the lower back to remove a small amount of spinal fluid. This test determines the levels of immune cells, proteins and antibodies in the fluid. This test might distinguish NMO from MS. The spinal fluid might show a very high level of white blood cells during NMO episodes. This is greater than the level usually seen in MS, although this symptom doesn't always happen. Stimuli response test. To learn how well the brain responds to stimuli such as sounds, sights or touch, you may have a test called an evoked potentials test or evoked response test. Wires called electrodes are attached to the scalp and, sometimes, the earlobes, neck, arms, legs and back. Equipment attached to the electrodes records the brain's responses to stimuli. These tests help find lesions or damaged areas in the nerves, spinal cord, optic nerve, brain or brainstem. Optical coherence tomography. This test looks at the retinal nerve fiber layer and its thickness. Patients with inflamed optic nerves from NMO have more-extensive vision loss and retinal nerve thinning than do people with MS.

    "disease": "Niemann-Pick disease",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease begins with a physical exam. The exam may show an early warning sign such as a liver or spleen that is too large. Your healthcare professional talks with you about symptoms and your family health history. Niemann-Pick disease is rare, and its symptoms can be similar to those of other health conditions, so testing is needed to get the right diagnosis.Diagnostic tests depend on the type of Niemann-Pick disease. Type A or B. Using blood or a tiny sample of skin, experts measure how much sphingomyelinase is in white blood cells. Sphingomyelinase is an enzyme that breaks down and uses fat. Type C. Experts use a blood sample to measure levels of a specific type of cholesterol called oxysterol. In rare cases, a small sample of skin also can be used to tell how the cells move and store cholesterol. Other tests also may be done, such as: Genetic testing. DNA testing of a blood sample may show the specific gene changes that cause Niemann-Pick disease types A, B and C. People who have only one copy of the gene change but do not have the condition are called carriers. DNA tests can show carriers for all types of Niemann-Pick disease if the gene changes have been identified in the first person in a family to have the condition. The gene change can be passed on to children. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI of the brain may show loss of brain cells. But in the early stages of Niemann-Pick disease, an MRI may not show any changes because symptoms usually show up before the loss of brain cells. MRI also can be used to look at the liver and spleen to see if they are large and to measure their size. Eye exam. An eye exam may show changes that could be caused by Niemann-Pick disease, such as problems with eye movements in type C and changes inside the eyes in types A and B. Prenatal testing. Ultrasound during pregnancy can show the large liver and spleen caused by Niemann-Pick disease type C. The liver and spleen also may be large in type A, but rarely in type B. Taking a sample of amniotic fluid from around the baby in the womb or taking a sample of tissue from the placenta may be done to diagnose Niemann-Pick disease. Genetic testing and counseling for families with a child with Niemann-Pick disease can give information about risks and family planning options.

Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions. A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. Calculating your BMI. Your health care professional checks your body mass index, called BMI. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have your BMI checked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you. Measuring your waist size. The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes. Gathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you.

During a pelvic exam, your doctor inserts gloved fingers into your vagina and simultaneously presses a hand on your abdomen in order to feel (palpate) your pelvic organs. The doctor also visually examines your external genitalia, vagina and cervix. Imaging tests. Tests, such as ultrasound or CT scans of your abdomen and pelvis, may help determine the size, shape and structure of your ovaries. Blood tests. Blood tests might include organ function tests that can help determine your overall health. Your doctor might also test your blood for tumor markers that indicate ovarian cancer. For example, a cancer antigen (CA) 125 test can detect a protein that's often found on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. These tests can't tell your doctor whether you have cancer, but they may provide clues about your diagnosis and prognosis. Surgery. Sometimes your doctor can't be certain of your diagnosis until you undergo surgery to remove an ovary and have it tested for signs of cancer. Genetic testing. Your doctor may recommend testing a sample of your blood to look for gene changes that increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Knowing you have an inherited change in your DNA helps your doctor make decisions about your treatment plan. You may wish to share the information with your blood relatives, such as your siblings and your children, since they also may have a risk of having those same gene changes. Once it's confirmed that you have ovarian cancer, your doctor will use information from your tests and procedures to assign your cancer a stage. The stages of ovarian cancer range from 1 to 4, which are often indicated with Roman numerals I to IV. The lowest stage indicates that the cancer is confined to the ovaries.

A positive test might suggest an early pregnancy. Corpus luteum cysts are normal to see during pregnancy. Pelvic ultrasound. A wandlike device (transducer) sends and receives high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your uterus and ovaries on a video screen (ultrasound). The image is used to confirm that you have a cyst, see its location, and determine whether it's solid or filled with fluid. Laparoscopy. A slim, lighted instrument (laparoscope) is inserted into your abdomen through a small cut (incision). Using the laparoscope, your provider can see your ovaries and any cyst. If a cyst is found, treatment is usually done during the same procedure. This is a surgical procedure that requires anesthesia. Tumor marker tests. Blood levels of a protein called a cancer antigen often are elevated in ovarian cancer. If your cyst appears solid and you're at high risk of ovarian cancer, your provider might order a cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) test or other blood tests. CA 125 levels can also be elevated in noncancerous conditions, such as endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease. Sometimes, less common types of cysts develop that a health care provider finds during a pelvic exam. Solid ovarian cysts that develop after menopause might be cancerous (malignant).

    "diagnosis": "Pancreatic cancer FAQs Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about pancreatic cancer from Mayo Clinic surgical oncologist Chee-Chee Stucky, M.D. Show transcript for video Pancreatic cancer FAQs Hi. I'm Dr. Chee-Chee Stucky, a surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you might have about pancreatic cancer. Is pancreatic cancer preventable? Technically, no. There are some risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer, like smoking and obesity. Those are both modifiable risk factors. So the healthier you are, the less risk you might have of pancreatic cancer. But ultimately if you have a pancreas, there's always a risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Do all pancreatic cysts become cancerous? The short answer is no. The vast majority of pancreatic cysts will not become cancerous. There are a few, but I would recommend asking your doctor about those. How are breast cancer and pancreatic cancer connected? The connection between breast cancer and pancreatic cancer is a genetic mutation called BRCA. So anybody who might have a newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer, but a family history of breast cancer, should definitely undergo genetic testing in order to see if there is a mutation present. If so, the rest of the family needs to undergo screening and possibly genetic testing with the hopes of potentially identifying cancer at an earlier stage. What is the Whipple procedure? The Whipple procedure is one of the most common procedures we do for pancreatic cancer, Specifically when located in the head or uncinate process of the pancreas. Because of where that tumor is located, we also have to remove everything that's connected to the pancreas, specifically the duodenum and the bile duct, as well as the surrounding lymph nodes. Once it's all removed, then we need to put everything back together, which includes the biliary tract, the pancreatic duct, and the GI tract. Can you live without a pancreas? You can definitely live without a pancreas. You will have diabetes. But fortunately with our new technologies, insulin pumps are much improved. And therefore, patients still have a good quality of life. How can I be the best partner to my medical team? You can be the best partner to your medical team by staying healthy, staying informed, ask a lot of questions and bring somebody with you to your appointments so they can be an additional set of eyes and ears. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish you well.

Tests and procedures used to diagnose pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors include: Blood tests. Blood tests may show excess hormones or other signs of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Blood samples also can be used to look for the DNA changes that signal an increased risk of these tumors. Urine tests. A test of your urine may show breakdown products that happen when your body processes hormones. Imaging tests. Imaging tests take pictures of the body. They can show the location and size of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Tests might include X-ray, MRI, CT and positron emission tomography, which also is called a PET scan. Imaging also might be done with nuclear medicine tests. These tests involve injecting a radioactive tracer into your body. The tracer sticks to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors so that they show clearly on the images. The pictures are often made with a PET scan that's combined with CT or MRI. Creating images of your pancreas from the inside of your body. During an endoscopic ultrasound, a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the tip, called an endoscope, is passed down your throat. It passes into your stomach and small intestine. The tube has a special ultrasound tool to create pictures of your pancreas. Other tools can be passed through the tube to collect a sample of the tissue. Removing a sample of tissue for testing, also called biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue for testing in a lab. The tissue might be removed during an endoscopic ultrasound. Sometimes surgery is needed to get the tissue sample. The sample is tested in a lab to see if it is cancer. Other special tests give more details about the cancer cells. Your health care team uses this information to make a treatment plan.

    "disease": "Parkinson's disease",
    "diagnosis": "Currently, there isn't a specific test to diagnose Parkinson's disease. A diagnosis is made by a doctor trained in nervous system conditions, known as a neurologist. A diagnosis of Parkinson's is based on your medical history, a review of your symptoms, and a neurological and physical exam.It can take time to diagnose Parkinson's disease. Healthcare professionals may recommend regular follow-up appointments with neurologists trained in movement disorders to evaluate your condition and symptoms over time and diagnose Parkinson's disease.Your healthcare team may order some of these tests and procedures: Physical and neurological exam. This includes taking your medical history and doing a neurological exam that tests your thinking and mental abilities, senses, coordination, and reflexes. Blood and lab tests. These are used to rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms. Imaging tests, such as an MRI, brain ultrasound and PET scan. These are used to rule out other conditions. They are not very helpful in diagnosing Parkinson's disease. A specific single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan called a dopamine transporter (DAT) scan. This can help support the suspicion that you have Parkinson's disease and help identify different types of tremor. But it is your symptoms and the results of your neurological exam that determine your diagnosis. Most people do not require a DAT scan. Genetic testing. This tests for gene changes if there is a known family history of Parkinson's disease or if you have early-onset disease. A short, low-dose treatment of medicines. You may be given medicines used to treat Parkinson's disease to see if you get better. If your symptoms show significant improvement, this may help confirm your diagnosis. You must be given a sufficient dose to show the benefit, as getting low doses for a day or two isn't reliable. Follow-up appointments. Regular appointments with neurologists trained in movement disorders may be needed over time to confirm a diagnosis. Alpha-synuclein test. This test, also called an alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay, detects Parkinson's disease before symptoms begin. Alpha-synuclein clumps are a hallmark sign of Parkinson's disease. Healthcare professionals can test for this condition in the skin or spinal fluid. Alpha-synuclein is found in Lewy bodies. It forms clumps that the body can't break down. The clumps spread and damage brain cells. In a 2023 study, researchers tested the spinal fluid of more than 1,000 people to look for clumps of the protein alpha-synuclein. The test accurately identified people with Parkinson's disease 87.7% of the time. The test also was highly sensitive for detecting people at risk of Parkinson's disease. This study of the alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay was the largest so far. Some researchers say the study may be a breakthrough for Parkinson's disease diagnosis, research and treatment trials. But larger studies are needed. There's hope among researchers that in the future, the test could be done using blood samples rather than spinal fluid.

This information helps your healthcare team understand your prognosis and which treatments are best for you. Results from a needle biopsy aren't always correct. Sometimes the results say a tumor isn't cancerous when it is. For this reason, some healthcare professionals don't do a biopsy before surgery. Instead, they may take a sample of tissue for testing during surgery. Imaging tests. Imaging tests help your healthcare team understand the size and location of your tumor.

Other tests can check for health issues linked with pectus excavatum that affect the heart and lungs. These tests may include: Chest X-ray. This test can make images of the dip in the breastbone. It often shows the heart being pushed into the left side of the chest. X-rays take only a few minutes to do. CT scan or MRI. Each of these tests can help find out how serious the pectus excavatum is. They also can show whether the heart or lungs are being compressed. CT scans and MRI scans take many images from various angles to make detailed images of the organs and tissues in the body. Electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram can show whether the heart's rhythm is regular or not. It also can show whether the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are timed properly. To do the test, a healthcare professional places sticky patches called electrodes on the chest. Wires connect the patches to a computer that prints or shows results. Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram can show real-time images of how well the heart and heart valves are working. To do the test, a healthcare professional presses a wand against the chest. The wand gives off sound waves that make pictures of the heart. An echocardiogram also shows whether the chest wall may be affecting heart function and the flow of blood through the heart. Lung function tests. These types of tests measure the amount of air that the lungs can hold. They also measure how quickly the lungs can push out air. Exercise function test.

To detect an ulcer, your healthcare professional may first take a medical history and do a physical exam. You also may need tests, such as: Laboratory tests for H. pylori. A blood, stool or breath test can show whether H. pylori is in your body. For the breath test, you drink or eat something that contains radioactive carbon. H. pylori breaks down the substance in your stomach. Later, you blow into a bag, which is then sealed. If you have H. pylori, your breath sample has the radioactive carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. If you take an antacid or an antibiotic, tell your healthcare professional. You may need to stop the medicine for a time. Both can affect test results. Endoscopy. During this procedure, your healthcare professional uses a long, flexible tube with a tiny camera, called an endoscope, to look at the upper part of your digestive system. Endoscopy involves passing the endoscope, down your throat and into your esophagus, stomach and small intestine to look for ulcers. If there's an ulcer, your health professional may remove a small tissue sample for study in a lab. This is called a biopsy. A biopsy also can show whether H. pylori is in your stomach lining. You're more likely to have endoscopy if you are older, have signs of bleeding, or have had recent weight loss or trouble eating and swallowing. If the endoscopy shows an ulcer in your stomach, you're likely to have a follow-up endoscopy after treatment. This can show if the ulcer has healed. Upper gastrointestinal series. Sometimes called a barium swallow, this series of X-rays of the upper digestive system makes pictures of your esophagus, stomach and small intestine. During the series of X-rays, you swallow a white liquid that has barium. The liquid coats your digestive tract and makes an ulcer easier to see.

Computerized tomography (CT). A CT scanner rotates around the body to take a series of images. A computer uses the image to make a detailed view of the peripheral nerve tumor. A CT scan can help your provider determine how the tumor may be affecting you. Electromyogram (EMG). For this test, small needles are placed in the muscles. An instrument records the electrical activity in the muscle as they're moved. Nerve conduction study. This test is often done with an EMG. It measures how fast the nerves carry electrical signals to the muscles. Tumor biopsy. If you have a nerve tumor, you may need a biopsy. A small sample of cells from the tumor is removed and analyzed. Depending on the tumor's size and location, you may need to have medicine that numbs an area of the body, called local anesthesia, or medicine that puts you to sleep, called general anesthesia, during the biopsy. Sometimes a biopsy is the only way to determine whether a tumor is cancerous. Nerve biopsy. A biopsy of the nerve may be needed in people who have certain conditions, such as progressive peripheral neuropathy and enlarged nerves that mimic nerve tumors.

During an EMG, a needle electrode is inserted through your skin into various muscles. The test evaluates the electrical activity of your muscles when they contract and when they're at rest. Test results tell your healthcare professional if there is damage to the nerves leading to the muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed views of your body in multiple planes. This test may be used if your healthcare professional suspects you have nerve root compression. High-resolution ultrasound. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of structures within the body. It's helpful for diagnosing nerve compression syndromes, such as carpal tunnel syndrome.

    "disease": "Pituitary tumors",
    "diagnosis": "Pituitary tumors often aren't noticed or aren't detected. In many cases, that's because the symptoms caused by pituitary tumors that make hormones, called functioning adenomas, and large tumors, called macroadenomas, are similar to those of other medical conditions. It's also because they grow very slowly over time. Small pituitary tumors that don't make hormones, called nonfunctioning microadenomas, often don't cause symptoms. If they are detected, it's typically because of an imaging exam, such as an MRI or a CT scan, that's done for another reason.To detect and diagnose a pituitary tumor, your health care provider will likely talk with you about your personal and family medical history and do a physical exam. Testing to detect a pituitary tumor also may include: Blood tests. Blood tests can show whether your body has too much or too little of certain hormones. For some hormones, blood test results that show too much of the hormone may be all that's needed for your health care provider to diagnose a pituitary adenoma. For other hormones, such as cortisol, a blood test result that shows too much of the hormone may need to be followed by other tests. Those tests can show if the earlier result was caused by a pituitary adenoma or by another health concern. Results that show hormone levels are too low need to be followed with other tests, usually imaging exams, to see if a pituitary adenoma may be the cause of those test results. Urine tests. A urine test may be used to help diagnose a pituitary adenoma that's making too much of the hormone ACTH. Too much ACTH leads to too much cortisol in the body and causes Cushing disease. MRI scan. A magnetic resonance imaging scan, also called an MRI scan, is a test that uses a magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves to create detailed images of the body's organs and tissues. An MRI of the brain can help detect a pituitary tumor and show its location and size. CT scan. A computed tomography scan, also called a CT scan, is a type of imaging test that combines a series of X-rays to create cross-sectional images. MRI scans are used more often than CT scans to detect and diagnose pituitary tumors. But a CT scan may be helpful in planning surgery if your health care provider tells you that a pituitary tumor must be removed. Vision testing. A pituitary tumor can affect eyesight, especially side vision, also called peripheral vision. Testing your eyes to check how well you can see may help your health care provider decide if other tests may be needed to detect a pituitary tumor. Your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in hormone disorders, called an endocrinologist, for more testing.

Blood tests are used to confirm an infection and to try to identify the type of organism causing the infection. However, precise identification isn't always possible. Chest X-ray. This helps your doctor diagnose pneumonia and determine the extent and location of the infection. However, it can't tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia. Pulse oximetry. This measures the oxygen level in your blood. Pneumonia can prevent your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. Sputum test. A sample of fluid from your lungs (sputum) is taken after a deep cough and analyzed to help pinpoint the cause of the infection. Your doctor might order additional tests if you're older than age 65, are in the hospital, or have serious symptoms or health conditions. These may include: CT scan. If your pneumonia isn't clearing as quickly as expected, your doctor may recommend a chest CT scan to obtain a more detailed image of your lungs. Pleural fluid culture.

Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the MVP is 8 or greater, or the AFI is 24 or greater.Depending on the timing and how serious polyhydramnios is, your health care team may recommend other tests to try to determine the cause of the polyhydramnios: Blood tests. These can check for infectious diseases linked with polyhydramnios. Amniocentesis. This is a procedure in which a sample of amniotic fluid is removed from the uterus for testing. The fluid contains fetal cells and various chemicals produced by the baby. The cells in the fluid also can be used for genetic testing if there is concern for a genetic disorder. Your health care team closely tracks your pregnancy if you have polyhydramnios. You may receive the following exams: Nonstress test. This test checks how your baby's heart rate reacts when your baby moves. During the test, you'll wear a special device on your stomach, also called the abdomen, to measure the baby's heart rate. A buzzer-like device also may be used to wake the baby and encourage movement. Biophysical profile. This test uses an ultrasound to provide more information about your baby's breathing, tone and movement. It also can help measure the volume of amniotic fluid in the uterus. It may be combined with a nonstress test. More InformationAmniocentesisGlucose challenge test",

This test involves inserting a thin needle electrode through the skin into the muscle. Electrical activity is measured as you relax or tighten the muscle, and changes in the pattern of electrical activity can confirm a muscle disease. The doctor can determine the distribution of the disease by testing different muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A scanner creates cross-sectional images of your muscles from data generated by a powerful magnetic field and radio waves. Unlike a muscle biopsy, an MRI can assess inflammation over a large area of muscle. Muscle biopsy. During this test, a small piece of muscle tissue is surgically removed for laboratory analysis.

    "diagnosis": "To diagnose popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES), the health team checks you and asks questions about your symptoms and health history. But because most people with PAES are young and usually in good health, diagnosing the condition can sometimes be challenging. There are typically no unusual findings from a physical exam.Tests are done to rule out other causes of leg pain, including muscle strains, stress fractures and peripheral artery disease, which results from clogged arteries.Tests may include the following: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement is usually the first test done to diagnose PAES. Blood pressure measurements are taken in the arms and legs during and after walking on a treadmill. The ABI is determined by dividing ankle pressure by arm pressure. The blood pressure in the legs should be higher than that in the arms. But if you have PAES, your ankle pressure drops during exercise. Duplex ultrasound of the calf uses high-frequency sound waves to show how fast blood moves through the leg arteries. This test may be done before or after exercise. You may be asked to flex your foot up and down, which puts your calf muscle to work. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) shows if the calf muscle is trapping the artery. It also can tell how much of the popliteal artery is narrowed. You may be asked to flex your foot or press it against a board during this test. Doing so helps show how blood is flowing to your lower leg. CT angiography also shows which leg muscle is causing the artery entrapment. As with MRA, you may be asked to move your foot during this test. Catheter-based angiography shows how blood is flowing to and from the lower leg in real time. It's done if the diagnosis is still unclear after other, less-invasive imaging tests.

If you have regular uterine contractions and your cervix starts to soften, thin and open, called dilate, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, you likely are in preterm labor.Tests and procedures to diagnose preterm labor include: Pelvic exam. This exam looks at how firm and tender your uterus is. It's done if your water hasn't broken and there's no worry that the placenta is covering the cervix. That condition is called placenta previa. Your healthcare professional does a pelvic exam to see if your cervix has started to open and to check for uterine bleeding. Ultrasound. A transvaginal ultrasound can measure the length of your cervix. An ultrasound also can show the fetus's size and position. And it can check for issues with the fetus or placenta and show the volume of amniotic fluid. Uterine monitoring. A uterine monitor measures how long your contractions last and how far apart they are. Lab tests. Your healthcare professional might take a swab of your vagina to check for certain infections and a substance called fibronectin. That substance acts like glue between the fetal sac and the lining of the uterus. It's released during labor. Your healthcare professional reviews these results with other risk factors.

These blood tests check the levels of certain proteins that may signal liver disease and bile duct injury. Antibody tests for signs of autoimmune disease. Blood tests may be done to check for anti-mitochondrial antibodies, also known as AMAs. These substances almost never occur in people without the disease, even if they have other liver disorders. Therefore, a positive AMA test is considered a very reliable sign of the disease. However, a small number of people with primary biliary cirrhosis don't have AMAs. Cholesterol test. More than half the people with primary biliary cholangitis have extreme increases in blood fats, including total cholesterol level. Imaging tests may help your healthcare team confirm a diagnosis or rule out other conditions with similar signs and symptoms. Imaging tests looking at the liver and bile ducts may include: Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of structures inside your body. FibroScan. Using an ultrasound-like probe, this test can detect scarring of the liver. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, also known as MRCP. This special MRI creates detailed images of your organs and bile ducts. Magnetic resonance elastography, also known as MRE. MRI is combined with sound waves to create a visual map of internal organs, called an elastogram. The test is used to detect hardening of your liver that might be a sign of cirrhosis. If the diagnosis is still uncertain, your healthcare professional may perform a liver biopsy. A small sample of liver tissue is removed through an incision using a thin needle. It's then tested in a lab, either to confirm the diagnosis or to determine the extent of the disease.

PLS can have symptoms similar to other neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and ALS. For this reason, you'll likely need several tests to rule out other diseases.A health care professional first takes a careful record of your medical history and family history and performs a neurological exam. Then you may have the following tests: Bloodwork. Blood tests check for infections or other possible causes of muscle weakness. MRI. An MRI or other imaging tests of your brain or spine might reveal signs that nerve cells have broken down. An MRI also can show other causes of symptoms, such as structural problems, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord tumors. Electromyogram (EMG). The test evaluates the electrical activity of muscles when they contract and when they're at rest. This test also measures the involvement of lower motor neurons. This can help tell the difference between PLS ⸺ an upper motor neuron disease ⸺ and ALS, which affects both upper and lower motor neurons. During an EMG, your doctor inserts a needle electrode through your skin into different muscles. Nerve conduction studies. This test can determine if you have nerve damage. A low amount of electrical current measures your nerves' ability to send impulses to muscles in different areas of your body. Lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. A spinal tap can help rule out multiple sclerosis, infections and other conditions. A thin, hollow needle inserted into your spinal canal removes small samples of cerebrospinal fluid. This is the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. The samples are then analyzed in a lab. Sometimes it takes 3 to 4 years before a diagnosis can be made. This is because early ALS can look like PLS until other symptoms surface a few years later. You might be asked to return for repeat EMGs over 3 to 4 years before a PLS diagnosis is confirmed.Genetic testing may be done when juvenile PLS is suspected. Genetic counseling also may be recommended.More InformationElectromyography (EMG)MRI",

I'm Dr. Humphreys, a urologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about prostate cancer. How do you know how fast my cancer is growing? If you have low to intermediate risk prostate cancer, there are genomic tests that can better inform on the risk of developing a more aggressive cancer. These tests look at the DNA of your actual cancer cells to compare them to other men, to come up with an individual risk profile for you and your cancer. None of it is 100%, but it does provide the best evidence based on your specific prostate cancer. Is prostate cancer sexually transmitted? No, there's no risk to your partner from prostate cancer. There's no risk with sexual activity. Prostate cancer is internal and does not spread through contact. Is prostate cancer hereditary? Some prostate cancers are hereditary. If you have prostate cancer, all of your first-degree relatives -- parent, sibling, or child -- are at an elevated risk for developing prostate cancer. If you are diagnosed when you're young in your 40s and develop prostate cancer, you may want to consider a genetic consultation to see if there are any known genetic risk factors that you and your family may have. What can I do to prevent or slow prostate cancer? There's no one thing. A healthy lifestyle with 30 minutes of exercise a day has shown to be protective. Also, diet is important by limiting red meat and eating fresh fruits and vegetables, low in sugars and carbohydrates. I would advise following a heart-healthy diet as research has shown that it is healthy for the prostate as well. Is there a risk of cancer spreading if I have a biopsy of my prostate? No, prostate cancer doesn't spread that way. And there have been millions of biopsies throughout the world and never a single incident of it being spread that way has ever been reported. When should I stop screening for prostate cancer? Not all prostate cancer is lethal and not all prostate cancer requires treatment. As a general rule of thumb, if your life expectancy is 10 years or less, you probably will not have to worry about prostate cancer affecting you in your lifetime. However, you should discuss this with your care team to determine how it specifically relates to you. How can I be the best partner to my medical team? The best thing you can do is be open and honest. Your medical team is here to be a resource to you, to support you and to help you in any way they can. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns that you have being informed makes all the difference. Thank you for your time and we wish you well. Prostate cancer diagnosis often starts with an exam and a blood test. A healthcare professional might do these tests as part of prostate cancer screening. Or you might have these tests if you have prostate cancer symptoms. If these first tests detect something concerning, imaging tests can make pictures of the prostate to look for signs of cancer. To be sure whether you have prostate cancer or not, a sample of prostate cells might be removed for testing.",

Your doctor will likely recommend treatment as soon as possible to prevent the rabies virus from infecting your body if there's a chance you may have been exposed to the rabies virus. Once a rabies infection is established, there's no effective treatment. Though a small number of people have survived rabies, the disease usually causes death. For that reason, if you think you've been exposed to rabies, you must get a series of shots to prevent the infection from taking hold. If you've been bitten by an animal that is known to have rabies, you'll receive a series of shots to prevent the rabies virus from infecting you.

This information is essential for determining how serious the illness is likely to be, which treatments to use and whether a person is likely to survive.Information important for determining an absorbed dose includes: Known exposure. Details about distance from the source of radiation and duration of exposure can help provide a rough estimate of the severity of radiation sickness. Vomiting and other symptoms. The time between radiation exposure and when vomiting starts is a fairly accurate screening tool to estimate absorbed radiation dose. The shorter the time before vomiting starts, the higher the dose. The severity and timing of other symptoms also may help medical personnel determine the absorbed dose. Blood tests. Frequent blood tests over several days enable medical personnel to look for drops in disease-fighting white blood cells and unusual changes in the DNA of blood cells. These factors indicate the degree of bone marrow damage, which is determined by the level of an absorbed dose. Dosimeter. A device called a dosimeter can measure the absorbed dose of radiation but only if it was exposed to the same radiation event as the affected person. Survey meter. A device such as a Geiger counter can be used to test people to see where in the body radioactive particles are located. Type of radiation.

Your symptoms are partially or temporarily relieved by activity, such as walking or stretching. Your symptoms are worse at night. Symptoms can't be explained solely by another medical or behavioral condition. Your healthcare professional may conduct a physical and a neurological exam. Blood tests, particularly for iron deficiency, may be ordered to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.You may be referred to a sleep specialist. This may involve an overnight stay and a study at a sleep clinic if another sleep condition such as sleep apnea is suspected. However, a diagnosis of RLS usually doesn't require a sleep study.

    "disease": "Retinal detachment",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves the steps that your healthcare professional takes to find out if retinal detachment is the cause of your symptoms. Your healthcare team may use the following tests and instruments to diagnose retinal detachment: Retinal exam. Your healthcare professional may use an instrument with a bright light and special lenses to check the back of your eye, including the retina. This type of device provides a detailed view of your whole eye. It lets your healthcare professional see any retinal holes, tears or detachments. Ultrasound imaging. Your healthcare professional may use this test if bleeding has happened in your eye. Bleeding makes it hard to see the retina. Your healthcare professional likely will check both eyes even if you have symptoms in just one. If a retinal tear is not found at this visit, your healthcare professional may ask you to return within a few weeks. The return visit is done to confirm that your eye has not developed a delayed retinal tear due to the same vitreous detachment. Also, if you have new symptoms, it's important to return to your healthcare professional right away.More InformationUltrasound",

    "diagnosis": "To make a diagnosis, an ophthalmologist performs a thorough eye exam and looks for irregularities anywhere in the eye.The following tests may be done to find the location and extent of the disease: Amsler grid test. An eye professional may use an Amsler grid to test the clarity of your central vision. You'll be asked if the lines of the grid seem faded, broken or distorted. Noting where the distortion is on the grid can help to understand the extent of retinal damage. If you have macular degeneration, you may be asked to use this test to self-monitor your condition at home. Optical coherence tomography (OCT). This test is an excellent technique for capturing precise images of the retina. This can help diagnose epiretinal membranes, macular holes and macular swelling, called edema. It also can monitor the extent of age-related wet macular degeneration and how it's responding to treatment. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF). FAF may be used to determine the stage of retinal diseases, including macular degeneration. FAF highlights a retinal pigment, called lipofuscin, that increases with retinal damage or dysfunction. Fluorescein angiography. This test uses a dye that causes blood vessels in the retina to stand out under a special light. This helps to exactly identify closed blood vessels, leaking blood vessels, new irregular blood vessels and subtle changes in the back of the eye. Indocyanine green angiography. This test uses a dye that lights up when exposed to infrared light. The resulting images show retinal blood vessels and the deeper, harder-to-see blood vessels behind the retina in a tissue called the choroid. Ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves, called ultrasonography, to help view the retina and other structures in the eye. It also can identify certain tissue characteristics that can help in the diagnosis and treatment of eye tumors. CT and MRI. In rare instances, these imaging methods can be used to help evaluate eye injuries or tumors.

Screening usually begins with blood and urine tests. It also may include testing for fatty acid oxidation disorders and other disorders.Sometimes other tests are needed to check for other conditions that may be affecting the liver or nervous system. For example: Spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. A spinal tap can help identify or rule out other diseases with similar symptoms. A spinal tap can reveal an infection of the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, known as meningitis. Or it can help diagnose swelling or an infection of the brain, called encephalitis. During a spinal tap, a needle is inserted through the lower back into a space between two bones. A small sample of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord is removed and sent to a lab for testing. Liver biopsy. A liver biopsy can help identify or rule out conditions that may be affecting the liver. In people with Reye's syndrome, a liver biopsy can show a buildup of fats in liver cells. During a liver biopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin on the upper right side of the stomach and into the liver. A small sample of liver tissue is removed and sent to a lab for analysis. CT scan or MRI. A head CT scan or MRI scan can help identify or rule out other causes of behavior changes or decreased alertness. These tests may show swelling in the brain, which may be caused by Reye's syndrome. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays taken from different angles to create a detailed image of the brain.

The subtraction SPECT coregistered to MRI (right) helps pinpoint the area of seizure activity by overlapping the SPECT results with brain MRI results. After a seizure, your healthcare professional reviews your symptoms and medical history and does a physical exam. You may have tests to find the cause of your seizure. Tests also may show how likely it is that you'll have another seizure.Tests may include: A neurological exam. This is to look at your behavior, motor abilities and how your brain works. Blood tests. A blood sample can show blood sugar levels and look for signs of infections or gene conditions. A health professional also may check the levels of salts in the body that manage the balance of fluids. These salts are called electrolytes. A spinal tap. This procedure collects a sample of fluid from the spine for testing. Also called a lumbar puncture, a spinal tap may show whether an infection caused a seizure. An electroencephalogram (EEG). In this test, electrodes are put on the scalp to record the electrical activity of the brain. The electrical activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may show a pattern that tells whether a seizure is likely to happen again. EEG testing also may help rule out other conditions that have symptoms like those of epilepsy. This test may be done at a clinic, overnight at home or over a few nights in the hospital. Imaging tests may include: MRI. An MRI scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of the brain. An MRI may show changes in the brain that could lead to seizures. CT scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to get cross-sectional images of the brain. CT scans can show changes in the brain that might cause a seizure. Those changes may include tumors, bleeding and cysts.

X-rays may be taken of the arms, hands, legs, feet, spine, ribs and skull. Such testing also can help find previous fractures. Eye exam. An eye exam can reveal bleeding in the eye and other eye injuries. Blood tests. Some metabolic and genetic conditions, as well as bleeding and clotting conditions, can cause symptoms similar to those of shaken baby syndrome. Blood tests can help rule out some of these conditions. MRI scan. MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of a child's brain and spine. It can show brain bruising, bleeding and signs of decreased oxygen. Because an MRI is difficult to perform on a child who's unstable, it's usually done 2 to 3 days after the injury. CT scan. A CT scan uses X-ray images to provide cross-sectional images of the body. A scan of the brain can help detect injuries that need urgent treatment. A scan of the abdomen also may be done to determine if there are other injuries.

But the symptoms could also be caused by something else, such as food poisoning.Allergy testing is the only sure way to tell what's causing your symptoms, so your provider may recommend one or both of these tests: Skin prick test. Small amounts of the proteins found in shellfish are pricked into skin on your arm or upper back. You're then watched for an allergic reaction. If you're allergic, you'll develop a raised bump (hive) at the test site on your skin. This typically takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Allergy specialists usually are best equipped to perform allergy skin tests. Blood test. A blood sample is sent to a lab to measure your immune system's response to a specific allergen. This test measures your immune system's response to shellfish proteins by measuring the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in your bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.

Home sleep testing also might be an option. Tests to detect sleep apnea include: Nocturnal polysomnography. During this test, you're hooked up to equipment that monitors your heart, lung and brain activity, breathing patterns, arm and leg movements, and blood oxygen levels while you sleep. Home sleep tests. Your health care provider might provide you with simplified tests to be used at home to diagnose sleep apnea. These tests usually measure your heart rate, blood oxygen level, airflow and breathing patterns. Your provider is more likely to recommend polysomnography in a sleep testing facility, rather than a home sleep test, if central sleep apnea is suspected. If the results aren't typical, your provider might be able to prescribe a therapy without further testing. Portable monitoring devices sometimes miss sleep apnea. So your health care provider might still recommend polysomnography even if your first results are within the standard range. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, your health care provider might refer you to an ear, nose and throat specialist to rule out a blockage in your nose or throat.

The test also can show if treatment for a sleep disorder is working. Sleep study, also called polysomnography. A sleep study records brain waves, oxygen levels in the blood, and heart rate and breathing during sleep. It also measures eye and leg movements. A sleep study may be done at a sleep disorders unit within a hospital or at a sleep center. When you have testing for sleep apnea, a diagnosis may be made during the first half of the night, while data from the rest of the night is used to decide on the best settings for a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. Sometimes the test is done over two different nights. Home sleep apnea test. Some people can have a test at home to diagnose sleep apnea. The small monitors usually record breathing rate and airflow, oxygen levels, and heart rate. Some tests also give information on blood vessel tone. This tells how well the muscles in the blood vessel walls control blood pressure and move blood around the body.

I'm Dr. Bassam Sonbol, an oncologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions patients may have about stomach cancers. Yes, they can be. People sometimes pass on DNA mutations to their kids that will put them at higher risk for having stomach cancers. Multiple things can raise suspicion that a stomach cancer is hereditary, such as having cancer at a younger age, having a history of other cancers or having a history of multiple cancers in the family. I think it's always advisable to get a second opinion from a specialized center that frequently treats stomach cancer, as these cancers are generally rare in the United States. Very frequently, the specialized center doctors can work with your local primary doctor as a team to take care of you. The answer is yes. But it depends on the staging and other factors. First, what's meant by cure is to get rid of the cancer completely and prevent it from coming back in the future. For gastric cancer that hasn't traveled to a different organ, cure as possible. And it's the main goal. An endoscopic procedure or surgery can achieve cure. Adding chemotherapy to surgery in some circumstances can also increase the chance of cure. In patients who have metastatic disease, cure is rarely achieved. Therefore, the treatment goal is to prolong life and improve quality of life. We know that systemic treatments, such as chemotherapy targeted therapies, and others, increase quality of life for the majority of patients, as it controls the cancer, along with multiple symptoms caused by the cancer itself. In addition, science is advancing every day and some of the treatments we have now were not available the year before. And with some newer treatments, we are encountering improvement in the overall outcomes and in some circumstances, long remissions. Be prepared for the visit, ask questions and keep communicating. Communication is important. Remember, if your doctor and the medical team does not hear from you, they assume that you're doing well. Therefore, it is important to communicate your symptoms, concerns, and other factors related to your care to your medical team. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish you well. Tests and procedures used to diagnose and detect stomach cancer include: Looking inside the stomach. To look for signs of cancer, your health care provider might use a tiny camera to see inside your stomach. This procedure is called upper endoscopy. A thin tube with a tiny camera on the end is passed down the throat and into the stomach. Taking a sample of tissue for testing. If something that looks like cancer is found in your stomach, it might be removed for testing. This is called a biopsy. It can be done during an upper endoscopy.

    "diagnosis": "Strokes FAQ Neurologist Robert D. Brown, Jr. M.D., M.P.H., answers the most frequently asked questions about strokes. Show transcript for video Strokes FAQ Neurologist Robert D. Brown, Jr. M.D., M.P.H., answers the most frequently asked questions about strokes. Hi, I'm Dr. Robert Brown, a neurologist at Mayo Clinic. And I'm here to answer some of the important question you may have about strokes. The fast acronym, F.A.S.T., is a good way of remembering stroke symptoms and what to do if you or a friend or loved one experiences those symptoms. F for facial weakness, A for arm weakness, S for speech slurring, and T for time. Time to call 911 should those symptoms occur. Sometimes stroke symptoms may be temporary, lasting only several minutes or hours, and this is called a transient ischemic attack. The symptoms should not be ignored even if they are temporary. The risk of stroke is markedly increased in the days and weeks after those symptoms occur, so seek emergency evaluation to clarify why the symptoms occurred and how best to prevent a future stroke. An aneurysm is a small saccular-shaped or berry-shaped out-pouching off of an artery in the brain. About two to three percent of the population has a brain aneurysm, and most never cause any symptoms. But on occasion, that aneurysm can rupture, leading to bleeding into and surrounding the brain, a bleeding type of stroke called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. People with that type of hemorrhage typically present with a sudden onset of a very severe headache, unlike anything they've ever experienced before, and they should seek emergency medical care. The brain cells are affected very quickly after a stroke occurs. In the most common type of stroke, called an ischemic stroke, or cerebral infarction, there's a lack of blood flow to an area of the brain leading the brain cells to begin to die off due to a lack of oxygen and other nutrients. Emergency treatments can sometimes be used to restore the blood flow. Stroke treatments are most effective if they can be used early after stroke symptoms occur. Most strokes are preventable. And stroke prevention is far more effective than trying to treat a stroke after it has occurred. There are both non-modifiable risk factors, those things we cannot change, and modifiable risk factors, those things that can be changed. Non-modifiable risk factors include age, race, gender, and family history of stroke. Modifiable risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, lack of regular exercise, obesity, heavy alcohol use, recreational drug use, and some types of heart disease. Every stroke is a little bit different because any area of the brain can be affected by a stroke. Some strokes lead to only mild symptoms, and others are more severe and have a major impact on speech, strength, swallowing, walking, and vision. The patient with a stroke will typically start therapies very early after a stroke, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. A person can continue to recover from a stroke for many months after a stroke up to a year or even longer. This recovery is a very gradual process. But don't give up. Celebrate the gains from week to week and month to month. If you have any stroke risk factors, partner with your medical team to control them. If stroke symptoms occur, seek emergency care. Work with your medical team to arrange for the appropriate evaluation to clarify why the stroke happened, and institute strategies to prevent another stroke from occurring in the future. Take your medications as advised. Your medical team will also institute therapies to help you with any deficit that you might have related to your stroke so that you can live your life to the fullest after a stroke occurs. Thank you for your time and we wish you well. During a stroke, things move quickly once you get to the hospita",

But it may not detect bleeding if you have a low red blood cell count or if there is a small amount of bleeding. Your healthcare professional may inject a contrast dye to view your blood vessels in greater detail, known as a CT angiogram. MRI. This imaging test also can detect bleeding in the brain. An MRI scan may show signs of a subarachnoid hemorrhage in rare cases when it's not detected by a CT scan. Your healthcare professional might inject a dye into a blood vessel to view the arteries and veins in greater detail, known as an MR angiogram. Cerebral angiography. You may have a cerebral angiography to get more-detailed images. Angiography also may be done if a subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected, but the cause isn't clear or doesn't appear on other imaging. A long, thin tube known as a catheter is inserted into an artery and threaded to your brain. Dye is injected into the blood vessels of your brain to make them visible under X-ray imaging. Sometimes a cerebral angiogram does not show an aneurysm. If this happens, you may have a second angiogram if your healthcare professional thinks an aneurysm is likely. For some people with an aneurysm that caused a subarachnoid hemorrhage, the bleeding may not appear on initial imaging. If this happens, you may need a lumbar puncture. During this procedure, a needle is inserted into the lower back. A small amount of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, known as cerebrospinal fluid, is removed. The fluid is then studied to look for blood, which may mean that you have a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

In the test, identical patches of common sun allergy triggers are applied to your skin, typically on the back. A day later, one of the areas receives a measured dose of UV rays from a sun lamp.

    "disease": "Suspicious breast lumps",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of a breast lump involves getting an exam and possibly tests to find out the cause of the lump. During the physical exam, your healthcare professional checks your breasts, chest wall, underarms and neck. You're checked while you're sitting upright and again while lying on your back.You'll likely need one or more imaging tests to check for changes in the breasts. These include: Diagnostic mammogram. This is an X-ray of your breasts. During a mammogram, your breasts are compressed between two firm surfaces. Then an X-ray takes black-and-white images. When your healthcare professional orders a diagnostic mammogram, this tells the radiologist who reviews your images that you have a new breast concern. A diagnostic mammogram is different from a screening mammogram, which looks for breast cancer before a person has symptoms. Focused or directed ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to make images of the inside of your breasts. The sound waves come from a wand-like instrument called a transducer that is moved over your breasts. Your healthcare professional tells the radiologist about the area of concern on the breast. Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI). This exam is done less often than mammogram and ultrasound. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to see inside your breasts. During an MRI, you lie in a large, tube-shaped machine that scans your body and makes images. Sometimes, the breast MRI may be done even if the diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound look regular. For example, MRI may be used if your breasts are very dense, and your healthcare professional has concerns about the clinical exam of your breasts. If these tests show that your lump is not cancer, you might need follow-up appointments. That way, your healthcare professional can check to see if the lump grows, changes or goes away.If imaging tests don't help diagnose the lump, your healthcare professional might take a sample of cells for lab testing. This is called a biopsy. There are various types of biopsies. Your healthcare professional recommends the one that is right for you. Breast biopsies include: Fine-needle aspiration. A small amount of breast tissue or fluid is removed with a thin needle. This procedure can be used to check a complex cyst or to drain fluid from a painful cyst. Core needle biopsy. A healthcare professional called a radiologist may do this procedure. A radiologist finds and treats health problems using medical imaging tests. With core needle biopsy, ultrasound is used to guide a needle into the breast lump and take a sample to check. Often, a tiny clip that you can't see or feel also is placed into the biopsied area. It serves as a marker that lets healthcare professionals find the area again during future checkups. Stereotactic biopsy. For this procedure, you lie face down on a padded table. One of your breasts is placed in a hole in the table. Breast X-rays provide a 3D view of the breast to help guide a needle to the lump to collect a tissue sample. You may need this procedure if a suspicious area shows up on a mammogram, but the area can't be found with ultrasound. A tiny clip often is placed at the time of the biopsy and serves as a marker for future appointments. Surgical biopsy. This procedure removes the entire breast lump. It's also called a lumpectomy or wide local excision. You receive medicine to keep you from feeling pain. You also may be given medicine that makes you sleep during the procedure. Whichever type of biopsy you have, your healthcare professional sends the tissue samples to a lab to be checked by a pathologist.

Pinpointing seizure location Enlarge image Close Pinpointing seizure location Pinpointing seizure location These SPECT images show the blood flow in the brain when there's no seizure activity (left) and during a seizure (middle). The subtraction SPECT coregistered to MRI (right) helps pinpoint the area of seizure activity by overlapping the SPECT results with brain MRI results. After a seizure, your healthcare professional reviews your symptoms and medical history. You may have tests to find the cause of your seizure. Knowing the cause helps show how likely it is that you'll have another seizure.Tests may include: Neurological exam. Your healthcare professional may test your behavior, motor abilities and mental function. This can show how well your brain and nervous system are working. Blood tests.

Flat metal discs called electrodes attached to your scalp record the electrical activity of your brain. This shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may show a pattern that tells whether a seizure is likely to happen again. An EEG also can help rule out other conditions that look like epilepsy. Computerized tomography, also called CT. A CT scan uses X-rays to get cross-sectional images of the brain. CT scans can show what may be causing seizures. The scans can show tumors, bleeding and cysts. MRI. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to show a detailed view of the brain. An MRI can show possible causes of seizures. Positron emission tomography, also called PET. PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material. A healthcare professional puts the material into a vein. The scan shows active areas of the brain.

A testicular ultrasound test uses sound waves to make pictures. It can be used to make pictures of the scrotum and testicles. During an ultrasound you lie on your back with your legs spread. A health care provider puts a clear gel on the scrotum. A hand-held probe is moved over the scrotum to make the pictures. Ultrasound gives your provider more clues about any lumps around the testicle. It can help your provider see whether the lumps look like something that isn't cancer or if they look like cancer. An ultrasound shows whether the lumps are inside or outside the testicle. Lumps inside the testicle are more likely to be testicular cancer. Blood tests. A blood test can detect proteins made by testicular cancer cells. This type of test is called a tumor marker test. Tumor markers for testicular cancer include beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein and lactate dehydrogenase. Having these substances in your blood doesn't mean you have cancer. Having levels higher than is typical is a clue your health care team uses to understand what's going on in your body. Surgery to remove a testicle. If your health care provider thinks a lump on your testicle may be cancerous, you might have surgery to remove the testicle. The testicle is sent to a lab for testing.

Sam Farres, M.D., Chair, Division of Vascular Surgery Mayo Clinic in Florida: Very broadly speaking, it can be divided into neurogenic thoracic outlet, if the nerves are compressed or irritated. The other type is vascular thoracic outlet, if the artery or the veins are compressed. And I would like to add a third type where both nerve and vessels are compressed, and that can be called non-specific TOS. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can I get thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) on both sides? Dr. Farres: Yes, that can happen. It's less common, but it can happen on right side, left side, dominant arm or the non-dominant one. Or some kind of combination. So that potentially can occur. [MUSIC PLAYING] How is thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) diagnosed? Dr. Farres: It's important to have a correct diagnosis for a thoracic outlet as this will determine what type of therapy and treatment is implemented. It's typically an exclusion of diagnosis, and this process starts with physical examination and good history, followed by imaging studies, vascular studies, provocative tests, and consultation with a multidisciplinary team in order to exclude what's usually more common. [MUSIC PLAYING] Who treats thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)? Dr. Farres: So thoracic outlet syndrome can be assessed and managed by multiple health professionals. At Mayo Clinic, Florida, we have a multidisciplinary team that typically assesses, diagnoses, and then manages thoracic outlet. So, in addition to vascular surgery as a team, we also have a peripheral neurologist who would assess the patient. Physical medicine and rehabilitation, peripheral neurologist, brachial plexus specialist, pain medicine, intervention radiology and regional anesthesia will help in the assessment and diagnosis of thoracic outlet and then the treatment. [MUSIC PLAYING] Video 2: All about thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS): Treatment [MUSIC PLAYING] Can I treat thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) with physical therapy and sports medicine? Sam Farres, M.D., Chair, Division of Vascular Surgery Mayo Clinic in Florida: Absolutely. In fact, physical therapy and sports medicine can be used effectively in treating particularly neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. Usually it focuses on improving posture and posture correction, in addition to strengthening and stretching exercises. Sports medicine can effectively offer guidance toward activity modification and pain management. And a tailored program and exercise for an individual patient can help in improving symptoms and avoiding invasive treatment. [MUSIC PLAYING] What are the treatment options for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)? Dr. Farres: Treatment options for TOS varies based on the underlying cause and the type of the TOS – neurogenic, vascular or non-specific. It's crucial to customize the treatment based on the underlying cause and to have it tailored through a multidisciplinary approach. Having said that, the most common treatment options are medications such as muscle relaxant, lifestyle modification, ergonomic movement, posture corrections. And more invasive would be injections and surgery as the form of the most invasive type of treatment.

A camera at the end of the endoscope transmits images to a video screen that your doctor watches for signs of abnormalities in your throat. Another type of scope (laryngoscope) can be inserted in your voice box. It uses a magnifying lens to help your doctor examine your vocal cords. This procedure is called laryngoscopy. Removing a tissue sample for testing. If abnormalities are found during an endoscopy or laryngoscopy, your doctor can pass surgical instruments through the scope to collect a tissue sample (biopsy). The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing. In the lab, specially trained doctors (pathologists) will look for signs of cancer. The tissue sample may also be tested for HPV, since the presence of this virus impacts the treatment options for certain types of throat cancer. Imaging tests.

    "diagnosis": "Thyroid cancer FAQs Endocrinologist Mabel Ryder, M.D., answers the most frequently asked questions about thyroid cancer. Show transcript for video Thyroid cancer FAQs Hi. I'm Dr. Mabel Ryder, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic, and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about thyroid cancer. The next step after thyroid cancer is diagnosed is to obtain a comprehensive, high-resolution ultrasound. This is important because papillary thyroid cancer and other types of thyroid cancer commonly spread to lymph nodes in the neck. If these are positive for thyroid cancer, fortunately, the surgeon will do a comprehensive surgery to remove both the thyroid and the lymph nodes. Fortunately, the prognosis for most patients with thyroid cancer is excellent. This means that the thyroid cancer is not life-threatening and very treatable. In a small group of patients, the disease may be advanced. With greater science, with data from the laboratory and clinical trials, and with technology, we're able to improve the treatments for our patients. And these patients have improved outcomes and better prognosis. Fortunately, for small thyroid cancers, it does not impact the function of the gland. We measure the function of the gland by measuring hormones called TSH and T4. And if these are normal, it means the thyroid function has been preserved. If you've been diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer, you may be able to save part of your thyroid. We know that most papillary thyroid cancers - under 3 to 4 centimeters - that are confined to the thyroid are low risk. This means that patients can undergo lobectomy to remove half the gland instead of the entire gland. The benefit of this is that you might be able to preserve your own thyroid function after surgery. Many patients are concerned about their quality of life and function after removing the thyroid gland. Fortunately, we have a hormone called levothyroxine or Synthroid. This hormone is bioidentical to the hormone your thyroid produced. It's safe. It's effective. And there's no side effects when you're on the right dose. The best way to partner with your team is to be open with your team about your questions, your fears and anxieties about your disease, and to be honest about your goals of care. Often writing your questions down and listing your priorities can be very helpful with you and your team determining what's the best next step for you. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish you well. Needle biopsy Enlarge image Close Needle biopsy Needle biopsy During needle biopsy, a long, thin needle is inserted through the skin and into the suspicious area. Cells are removed and tested to look for signs of cancer. Tests and procedures used to diagnose thyroid cancer include: Physical exam. Your health care provider will examine your neck to feel for changes in your thyroid, such as a lump (nodule) in the thyroid. The provider may also ask about your risk factors, such as past exposure to radiation and a family history of thyroid cancers. Thyroid function blood tests. Tests that measure blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and hormones produced by your thyroid gland might give your health care team clues about the health of your thyroid. Ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create pictures of body structures. To create an image of the thyroid, the ultrasound transducer is placed on your lower neck. The way a thyroid nodule looks on an ultrasound image helps your provider determine if it's likely to be cancer. Signs that a thyroid nodule is more likely to be cancerous include calcium deposits (microcalcifications) within the nodule and an irregular borde",

But in order to treat your symptoms, your doctor will also try to identify whether your tinnitus is caused by another, underlying condition. Sometimes a cause can't be found.To help identify the cause of your tinnitus, your doctor will likely ask you about your medical history and examine your ears, head and neck. Common tests include: Hearing (audiological) exam. During the test, you'll sit in a soundproof room wearing earphones that transmit specific sounds into one ear at a time. You'll indicate when you can hear the sound, and your results will be compared with results considered normal for your age. This can help rule out or identify possible causes of tinnitus. Movement. Your doctor may ask you to move your eyes, clench your jaw, or move your neck, arms and legs. If your tinnitus changes or worsens, it may help identify an underlying disorder that needs treatment. Imaging tests. Depending on the suspected cause of your tinnitus, you may need imaging tests such as CT or MRI scans. Lab tests. Your doctor may draw blood to check for anemia, thyroid problems, heart disease or vitamin deficiencies. Do your best to describe for your doctor what kind of tinnitus noises you hear. The sounds you hear can help your doctor identify a possible underlying cause. Clicking. This type of sound suggests that muscle contractions in and around your ear might be the cause of your tinnitus. Pulsing, rushing or humming. These sounds usually stem from blood vessel (vascular) causes, such as high blood pressure, and you may notice them when you exercise or change positions, such as when you lie down or stand up. Low-pitched ringing. This type of sound may point to ear canal blockages, Meniere's disease or stiff inner ear bones (otosclerosis). High-pitched ringing. This is the most commonly heard tinnitus sound. Likely causes include loud noise exposure, hearing loss or medications. Acoustic neuroma can cause continuous, high-pitched ringing in one ear.

A number of tests and procedures are used to help diagnose tongue cancer. Which ones are best for you depends on your medical history and symptoms.Testing for tongue cancer may include: Examining the mouth and throat. In a physical exam, a member of your health care team looks at your mouth, throat and neck. That person checks for any lumps on the tongue and for swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Using a tiny camera to look at the mouth and throat. Called an endoscopy, this test uses a thin tube with a light and camera. The tube is inserted into the nose and passed down to the throat. It looks for signs of tongue cancer in the mouth and throat. It also may be used to see if the cancer has spread by looking at other parts of the throat, such as the voice box. Removing a tissue sample for testing. Called a biopsy, this test involves taking a sample of cells from the tongue. There are different types of biopsy procedures. A sample may be collected by cutting out a piece of the suspicious tissue or the entire area. Another type of biopsy uses a thin needle that's inserted directly into the suspicious area to collect a sample of cells. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. In the lab, tests can show whether the cells are cancerous. Other tests give more information about the cancer cells, such as if they show signs of HPV. Imaging tests. Imaging tests capture pictures of the body. The pictures can show the size and location of the cancer. Imaging tests used for tongue cancer may include X-rays and CT, MRI and positron emission tomography, also called PET, scans. Sometimes an X-ray involves a barium swallow. In this type of X-ray, a liquid called barium helps to check for signs of cancer in the throat. Barium coats the throat and makes it easier to see on X-rays. An ultrasound may be used to look for cancer in the lymph nodes. Ultrasound creates pictures using sound waves. It might show whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the neck.

Pinpointing seizure location Enlarge image Close Pinpointing seizure location Pinpointing seizure location These SPECT images show the blood flow in the brain when there's no seizure activity (left) and during a seizure (middle). The subtraction SPECT coregistered to MRI (right) helps pinpoint the area of seizure activity by overlapping the SPECT results with brain MRI results. After a seizure, see a healthcare professional to thoroughly review your symptoms and medical history. You may need several tests to determine the cause of your seizure. The tests can evaluate how likely it is that you'll have another one.Tests may include: Neurological exam. You may have a test of your behavior, ability to move and control your muscles, and ability to think, understand and solve problems. This helps determine if there's a health issue with your brain or other part of your nervous system. Blood tests. A blood sample can check for signs of infections, blood sugar levels or electrolyte imbalances. Lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. You may need to have a sample of cerebrospinal fluid removed for testing if an infection might have caused the seizure. Electroencephalogram (EEG). In this test, flat metal discs called electrodes attached to your scalp record the electrical activity of your brain. This shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may reveal a pattern that tells whether a seizure is likely to occur again. EEG testing also may help exclude other conditions that could cause a seizure. CT scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal tumors, bleeding and cysts in the brain that might cause a seizure. MRI. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. An MRI shows the structure of the brain. This can help determine what may be causing the seizures. Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein. The material helps visualize active areas of the brain. This can help a healthcare professional see where seizures are occurring. Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein. The test creates a detailed, 3D map of the blood flow activity in your brain that happens during a seizure. You may have a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to magnetic resonance imaging, also called SISCOM.

    "disease": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA)",
    "diagnosis": "A prompt evaluation of your symptoms is vital to diagnose the cause of a transient ischemic attack. It also helps your healthcare professional determine the best treatment. To pinpoint the cause of the TIA and to assess your risk of a stroke, your healthcare professional may rely on the following: Physical exam and tests. Your healthcare professional performs a physical exam and a neurological exam. Tests of your vision, eye movements, speech and language, strength, reflexes, and sensory system are included. Your healthcare professional may use a stethoscope to listen to the carotid artery in your neck. During this exam, a whooshing sound called a bruit may mean that you have atherosclerosis. Or your healthcare professional may use an ophthalmoscope. This instrument looks for cholesterol fragments or platelet fragments called emboli in the tiny blood vessels of the retina at the back of the eye. You also may be checked for risk factors of a stroke. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes and sometimes high levels of the amino acid homocysteine. Carotid ultrasonography. If your healthcare professional suspects that a narrowed carotid artery in the neck may be the cause of your TIA, you may need a carotid ultrasound. A wandlike device called a transducer sends high-frequency sound waves into the neck. The sound waves pass through the tissue and create images on a screen. The images can show narrowing or clotting in the carotid arteries. Computerized tomography (CT) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) scans. CT scans of the head use X-ray beams to create a 3D image. This allows your healthcare professional to look at the brain or the arteries in the neck and brain. A CTA scan may involve an injection of a contrast material into a blood vessel. Unlike a carotid ultrasound, a CTA scan can look at blood vessels in the neck and head. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). These tests use a strong magnetic field to create a 3D view of the brain. MRA uses technology similar to MRI to look at the arteries in the neck and brain. But an MRA may include an injection of a contrast material into a blood vessel. Echocardiography. This test may be done to find out if a heart issue caused fragments in the blood that led to a blockage. A traditional echocardiography is called a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). A TTE involves moving an instrument called a transducer across the chest to look at the heart. The transducer emits sound waves that bounce off different parts of the heart, creating an ultrasound image. Or you may need another type of echocardiography called a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). A flexible probe with a transducer is placed into the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach, known as the esophagus. Because the esophagus is directly behind the heart, a TEE can create clearer, detailed ultrasound images. This allows a better view of some things, such as blood clots, that might not be seen clearly in a traditional echocardiography exam. Arteriography. This procedure is used in some people to get a view of arteries in the brain not usually seen in an X-ray. A radiologist inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through a small incision, usually in the groin. The catheter is guided through the major arteries and into the carotid or vertebral artery in the neck. Then a dye is injected through the catheter. The dye allows the arteries to be seen on X-ray images.

A small tube with a camera on it is placed through a small cut in the belly. Laparoscopy is done to locate a testicle in the stomach area. The surgeon might be able to fix the undescended testicle during the same procedure. But another surgery might be needed. Sometimes, laparoscopy might not find an undescended testicle. Or it might find damaged or dead testicle tissue that doesn't work, and the surgeon removes it. Open surgery. This uses a larger cut to look inside the stomach area or groin to find the undescended testicle. If a baby's testicles can't be found in the scrotum after birth, more tests may be needed. These tests can determine if the testicles are absent — meaning not there at all — rather than undescended. Some health issues that lead to absent testicles can cause serious problems soon after birth if they're not found and treated.Imaging tests, such as an ultrasound and MRI, usually aren't needed to find out if a baby has an undescended testicle.

This cancer is often diagnosed after other types of cancer have been ruled out.Tests and procedures may include: Physical exam. Your doctor will ask you questions about when your symptoms began and if they've changed over time. He or she will examine the area to better understand the size and depth of the growth, whether it's connected to nearby tissues, and whether there are any signs of swelling or nerve damage. Imaging tests. Your doctor may recommend imaging tests to create pictures of the affected area and understand more about your condition. Imaging tests may include X-rays, CT, MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Removing a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). To make a definitive diagnosis, your doctor collects a sample of the tumor tissue and sends it to a lab for testing. Depending on your particular situation, the tissue sample may be collected with a needle inserted through your skin or during an operation. In the lab, doctors trained in analyzing body tissues (pathologists) examine the sample to determine the types of cells involved and whether the cells are likely to be aggressive. This information helps rule out other types of cancer and guides your treatment. Determining the type of biopsy needed and the specifics of how it should be performed requires careful planning by the medical team. Doctors need to perform the biopsy in a way that won't interfere with future surgery to remove the cancer. For this reason, ask your doctor for a referral to a team of experts with extensive experience in treating soft tissue sarcomas before the biopsy.

An ultrasound of the area behind your abdominal organs (retroperitoneal ultrasound) allows your provider to view the kidneys and ureters. Bladder catheterization. To test for incomplete or blocked urine flow, your provider inserts a small tube (catheter) through the urethra, injects dye into your bladder, and takes X-rays of your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra before and during urination. Renal nuclear scan. Your provider or a technician injects a tracer that contains a small amount of radioactive material into your arm. A special camera detects the radioactivity and produces images that your provider uses to evaluate the urinary system. Cystoscopy. A small tube with a camera and light is inserted into your urethra or through a small incision. The optical system allows the provider to see inside the urethra and bladder.

These tests look for signs of inflammation, such as a high level of C-reactive protein. A complete blood cell count can tell whether you have enough red blood cells. Other blood tests, such as the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test, can look for certain antibodies. These tests can help diagnose vasculitis. Imaging tests. Imaging tests can show which blood vessels and organs are affected. They also can help your healthcare professional know how you respond to treatment. Imaging tests for vasculitis include X-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, MRIs and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. X-rays of your blood vessels. During this procedure, called angiography, a flexible catheter resembling a thin straw goes into a large artery or vein. A special dye goes into the catheter. You have X-rays taken as the dye fills the artery or vein. The X-rays show the outlines of your blood vessels. Biopsy. This is a surgery in which a healthcare professional removes a small sample of tissue from the affected area of your body. Your health professional then looks at the tissue for signs of vasculitis.

Your healthcare professional may massage the main arteries in your neck to see if that causes you to feel faint.Your healthcare professional also may recommend several tests to rule out other possible causes of your fainting — particularly heart-related conditions. These tests may include: Electrocardiogram. This test records the electrical signals your heart produces. It can detect irregular heart rhythms and other cardiac conditions. You may need to wear a portable monitor for at least a day or as long as a month. Echocardiogram. This test uses ultrasound imaging to view the heart and look for conditions such as valve problems that can cause fainting. Exercise stress test. This test studies heart rhythms during exercise. It's usually conducted while you walk or jog on a treadmill. Blood tests. Your healthcare professional may look for conditions such as anemia that can cause or contribute to fainting spells. Tilt table test. If no heart conditions appear to cause your fainting, your healthcare professional may suggest that you undergo a tilt table test. During the test, you lie flat on your back on a table that changes positions, tilting you upward at various angles. A technician monitors your heart rhythms and blood pressure during the test to see if changing your posture affects them.

    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves the steps that your healthcare professional takes to find out if your child has vesicoureteral reflux. A urine test can reveal whether your child has a UTI. Other tests may be needed, including: Kidney and bladder ultrasound. This imaging test uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of the kidney and bladder. Ultrasound can find out if parts of either organ don't look regular. This same test often is used during pregnancy to track a baby's development. It also may reveal swollen kidneys in the baby. That can be a symptom of primary vesicoureteral reflux. Specialized X-ray of the urinary system. This test is called a voiding cystourethrogram, or VCUG. It uses X-rays of the bladder when it's full and when it's emptying to spot clues to health issues. During the test, your child lies back on an X-ray table. A healthcare professional places a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the urethra and into the bladder. Contrast dye is injected into the bladder through the catheter. Then the bladder is X-rayed. Next, the catheter is removed so that your child can urinate. More X-rays are taken of the bladder and urethra during urination. This lets the healthcare professional see whether the urinary tract is working correctly. The test likely won't be painful. But the healthcare professional may give your child calming medicine called a sedative first. Risks of this test include discomfort from the catheter or from having a full bladder. The test may raise the risk of a new urinary tract infection. It also may expose your child to a small amount of radiation. Nuclear scan. This test uses a tracer called a radioisotope. The scanner detects the tracer and shows whether the urinary tract is working correctly. Risks include discomfort from the catheter and discomfort during urination. The test involves less exposure to radiation than does a VCUG. Try to get tested at a center that has lots of experience using catheters. If your baby or young child needs a VCUG, choose a center that knows how to minimize radiation exposure.",

    "diagnosis": "Liver biopsy Enlarge image Close Liver biopsy Liver biopsy A liver biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of liver tissue for laboratory testing. A liver biopsy is commonly performed by inserting a thin needle through the skin and into the liver. Diagnosing Wilson's disease can be hard because its symptoms often are like other liver diseases, such as hepatitis. Also, symptoms can occur over time. Changes in behavior that come on gradually can be especially hard to link to Wilson's disease.Doctors rely on symptoms and test results to make the diagnosis. Tests and procedures used to diagnose Wilson's disease include: Blood and urine tests. Blood tests can monitor your liver function and check the level of a protein called ceruloplasmin that binds copper in the blood. They can check the level of copper in your blood too. Your doctor also might want to measure the amount of copper removed in your urine during a 24-hour period. Eye exam. Using a microscope with a high-intensity light, an eye doctor checks your eyes for Kayser-Fleischer rings. This is called a slit-lamp exam. These rings are caused by extra copper in the eyes. Wilson's disease also is related to a type of cataract, called a sunflower cataract. This cataract can be seen during an eye exam. Removing a sample of liver tissue for testing, also known as a biopsy. In a biopsy, your doctor inserts a thin needle through your skin and into your liver. Then your doctor draws a small sample of tissue. A laboratory tests the tissue for extra copper. Genetic testing. A blood test can pinpoint the genetic changes that cause Wilson's disease. If you have the changed gene that causes Wilson's disease, doctors also can screen any siblings. If any have the changed gene, that sibling can start treatment before symptoms begin.

    "diagnosis": "To diagnose a yeast infection, your healthcare professional may: Ask about your medical history. This might include past vaginal infections or sexually transmitted infections. Do a pelvic exam. This involves looking at your outer genitals for signs of infection. Then your healthcare professional puts an instrument called a speculum into your vagina. The speculum holds the vaginal walls open so the vagina and cervix are easy to see. The cervix is the lower, narrower part of the uterus. Test vaginal fluids. Lab tests of vaginal fluid can look for yeast or find the type of fungus causing the yeast infection. Knowing the fungus can help your healthcare professional suggest treatment.

    "disease": "Zollinger-Ellison syndrome",
    "diagnosis": "A healthcare professional usually bases a diagnosis on the following: Medical history. A medical professional typically asks about symptoms and reviews a medical history. Blood tests. A sample of blood is examined to check for high gastrin levels. While high gastrin levels may suggest tumors in the pancreas or duodenum, high gastrin levels also can be caused by other conditions. For example, gastrin may be higher if your stomach isn't making acid or if you have had gastric surgery. Taking acid-reducing medicines also can raise gastrin levels. You need to fast before this test. You also may need to stop taking acid-reducing medicine. Because gastrin levels can vary, this test may be repeated a few times. You also may have a secretin stimulation test. Secretin is a hormone that regulates gastric acid. For this test, a medical professional first measures your gastrin levels. You'll then be given an injection of secretin. Your gastrin levels will be measured again. If you have Zollinger-Ellison, your gastrin levels will rise dramatically. Your blood also may be tested for a protein called chromogranin A, which is high in most people with gastrinomas. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This test requires sedation. An endoscopy involves putting a thin, flexible instrument down the throat and into the stomach and duodenum. This instrument is called an endoscope. It has a light and a camera at the end of it. It allows a medical professional to look for ulcers. During the endoscopy, tissue samples may be removed. This is called a biopsy. The tissue will be examined for gastrin-producing tumors. Endoscopy also can find out whether the stomach is making acid. If the stomach is making acid and the gastrin level is high, then the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison can be established. You will be asked to fast after midnight the night before the test. Endoscopic ultrasound. This procedure uses an endoscope fitted with an ultrasound probe. The probe makes it easier to spot tumors in your stomach, duodenum and pancreas. Your healthcare professional may remove a tissue sample through the endoscope. This test also requires fasting after midnight and sedation. Imaging tests. Imaging techniques may be used to look for tumors, such as CT scans, MRI imaging and Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT scanning.
